         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T will make much for the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the place in hand and of this Epiſtle, to know the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Apoſtles writing; for thereby we ſhall more eaſily come to the vnderſtanding of the things deliuered by the Apoſtle.</p>
               <p>The occaſion is drawne from the text it ſelfe: for whoſoeuer will know the drift of the Scripture, muſt take it from the place of Scripture it ſelfe, being ſometimes ſet in the beginning, as in the booke of the Prouerbes: ſometimes in the later end, as in the generall Epiſtle of <hi>Peter:</hi> Sometimes in the middeſt, as 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> in one verſe the drift is deliuered. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:17926:3"/> of the whole body of the Scripture, that is han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled, whether Pſalme, Prophecy, Epiſtle, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The point in hand is ſet forth in the 6. 7. 8. verſes. In the 8. verſe the occaſion, which was this, that whereas the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> had receaued the Goſpell well and ſoundly preached vnto them, firſt they ſuffered themſelues to go a ſide and to follow vaine conceits, or reaſons drawne from Philoſophie; in the ſixth and ſeuenth the ſecond cauſe is ſhewed: which is, that they ſuffered themſelues to be lead away to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ceremonies of the Law: which before had been the ordinances of God, but beeing ceaſed are become the traditions of men, as the Apoſtle cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them.</p>
               <p>For the better vnderſtanding of this Epiſtle, we are to know the conueyance of the matter of it. And as in all <hi>Paules</hi> Epiſtles he vſeth to ſet downe firſt the principall grounds of religion: Secondly, the exhortations. And as he vſeth in other, ſo doth he in this Epiſtle. It therefore contayneth-two poyntes: firſt, the deliuery of the body and of the ſubſtantiall poyntes in religion of our Sauiour.</p>
               <p>The ſecond parte (beginning at the 3. chapter) is a declaration of the godly conuerſation, wherein all true profeſſors of the Goſpell, which profeſſe CHRIST, muſt liue.</p>
               <p>The firſt and ſecond Chapters are of doctrine, the other of manners. In the firſt is deliuered the truth, and ſincere and plaine doctrine (in briefe) of the Goſpell ſet forth. In the ſecond are rooted vp and throwne downe all thoſe wretched opinions, which were by the falſe Apoſtles ſowne in the hearts of the <hi>Coloſſians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That, which he ſpeaketh of manners, beginneth
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:17926:3"/> at the third Chapter, where firſt the Apoſtle exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth generally to all good, holy &amp; righteous workes: Secondly from the generall, he falleth to the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular declaration of thoſe duties, he would haue them practize. As of maſters to ſeruants, parents to children, and children to parents, of husbands to wiues, and wiues to husbands &amp;c. And then retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth againe to generall exhortations; and this is, as it were, the generall conueyance of the matter of the Epiſtle.</p>
               <p>In this text to the 14. verſe he doth labour to draw the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> to the knowledge of his loue to them: which he doth firſt by his preface, which is vſuall in all his Epiſtle, is n his ſalutations, wherein he wiſheth good things vnto them from God. The 2. thing to perſwade them of his loue is a teſtification that he did pray for them in both kindes; both by prayſing and thanking God for thinges they had receaued, and by petition, where he prayed to God, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the increaſe of the graces of God in them. And hereby he inſinuateth himſelfe and ſtampeth, as it were, in their mindes his loue and affection to them, to the end his doctrine might be the better recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by them.</p>
               <p>1 As if he ſhould ſay, I <hi>Paule</hi> vnderſtanding that there are ſome, that go about to ſpoyle you, and to make a prey of you, partly by ſhew of wiſdome and Phyloſophy, and partely by the beggerly elements or ceremonies of the Iewes, thought it needfull to write vnto you, that according as you haue receaued IESVS CHRIST at the firſt, euen ſo that you would both abide and proceed further in him, that you may be rooted and further built in the faith.</p>
               <p>And that I write vnto you, know, that I doe it with

And conſidering that the bleſſing of all labours dependeth vpon the Lord, our beginning is with harty prayer vnto God, for the grace and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of God to be freely giuen, together with all the bleſſings both of this life, &amp; of the life to come, from God the father, &amp; from our Lord IESVS CHRIST to you <hi>Coloſſians:</hi> yet not all that dwell in that Cittie, but vnto thoſe alone, which by faith are Saintes, and brethren, not in the fleſh, but in IESVS CHRIST.</p>

               <p>Firſt the Apoſtle ſets ſorth himſelfe by his name <hi>Paul,</hi> He had two names giuen him, one at his Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion viz. <hi>Saul,</hi> his father being a Gentile, hee had another name vid. <hi>Paul,</hi> in regard that they would keepe a note of his priuiledge in <hi>Rome.</hi>

               <p>Secondly, for the Apoſtles calling. If one had aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him, what calling haue you to deale with vs? hee anſweres, that he was an Apoſtle, which had a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall charge ouer the whole world. Indeed there is great difference betweene the Miniſters now, which may not roue about, but haue their charge, and place limited them, as if they had but one plough-land to till: Whereas the Apoſtles Miniſtery was generall, they had the field of the whole world to Till by their meſſage, and by their miracles, for the publication &amp; confirmation of the word. As in time of warres, it is neceſſary that there ſhould be a Generall and Lord Marſhall, but when that warres are ceaſed and there is peace there needeth onely to bee a Garriſon and Captaine made for them. So when as the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of the Goſpell was to be made ouer the world, it was neceſſary there ſhould bee Apoſtles as Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, afterward it was ſufficient to haue the Paſtors, Doctors, and Elders, as a Garriſon in the Church of

               <p>Next from the teſtification of the loue, hee did beare vnto them, from this verſe to the end of the Preface, which he laboureth in, as a Miniſter ought, to teſtifie his affection towards them, whereby the word might bee more louingly receiued and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, willingly and carefully practiſed: <label type="milestone">

               <p>His loue he teſtifieth, 1. by a louing ſalutation, &amp; then by teſtifying that hee daily prayed for them, both thanking God, and deſiring all good things for them, and he proueth his prayer in a forme of thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing &amp; petition for them which he ſetteth downe.</p>

More parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly the miniſter is to pray for his people, not only in the Church, but priuately at home, as the Apoſtle here did. And therfore we muſt not thinke our ſelues diſcharged of priuate prayer for publicke. Which ſheweth it is a dutie of all Chriſtians, as to pray in the Church, ſo alſo to pray priuately in their families, and alſo by themſelues, and therfore to ſet a time apart for that purpoſe. Reaſons of it are great:<note place="margin">Reaſons of priuat praier.</note> firſt there is no man or woman of what ſtate ſoeuer, but they haue particular ſins, which euery one hath not. For when they pray in the houſe, they deſire pardon of ſinnes, which are common to the houſe: but I may haue committed a ſinne the which they haue not, and I may haue receaued particular bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, which others haue not, and I haue need of ſome particular bleſſing in my place, that others haue not need of.

Where he meeteth with the corruption of men, that will pray, and deſire worldly thinges, and will labour migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely in the comforts of this preſent life, and neuer make mention of theſe, which are principal, whereas the other are but ſweepinges, and thoſe thinges which are to be caſt to dogs, in compariſon, and as dung and droſſe, nay leſſe then nothing in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of CHRIST, and the thinges belonging to him, which are of moſt ſingular price.

               <p>The Apoſtle doth not here ſhut out all men, euen thoſe that are aliens from the houſe of God, for the Iewes, Turkes &amp;c. are our neighbours and of our fleſh, as the Apoſtle ſaith, and therefore to be prayed for. Here we are to examine our ſelues whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we haue true loue or no, <hi>Viz.</hi> if we loue the Saints <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iz.</hi> thoſe that are ioyned to vs in the bond of Chriſtianitie: for our loue is vſually ſo ſtrait laced, that it cannot goe from our ſelues, and if it goe to our wiues and thoſe in our houſe: yet ſo poore it is, that it cannot goe out of our doores ouer our threſhold, where as we are to loue others, euen
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:17926:12"/> thoſe that hate vs, to ſpeake well of thoſe that ſpeake ill of vs.<note place="margin">Math. 5.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And our loue muſt be to all the Saintes, to the poore aſwell as to the rich, whom Saint <hi>Iames</hi> mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth with and ſayeth: If a poore man, though of the true religion, come in, he is bid to goe behind the dore and to ſit at our foot-ſtoole; if one rich he is<note place="margin">Iames. 2. 3. 4.</note> exalted: whereas true loue doth embrace euen all, that doe profeſſe the truth. Here Saint <hi>Iames</hi> diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth the hipocriſy of men in their excuſes: why (will they ſay) are not we to loue our neighbours? and the rich men are our neighbours. True, he is your neighbour, but if you loue him, why doe you not loue him alſo, that is poore, which is more neare peraduenture, if he be a profeſſor: and againe if your loue be to the rich, becauſe of the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, then ye will loue the poore aſwell as the rich. As if for the loue of God ye abſtaine from adultery, theft, murder &amp;c. Then ye will abſtaine from all other ſinnes, which are of the ſame nature, all the commaundements being of the ſame nature, comming from God, who is one and the ſame; and therfore if I abſtaine from one ſinne for the loue of<note place="margin">Note.</note> Gods ſake, I will aſwell abſtaine from another for that cauſe. And therefore this condemneth the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon practize of men, that being blamed for ſome one ſinne; as drunkeneſſe &amp;c. will ſay I am no theefe, no murderer &amp;c, and ſo will iuſtifie himſelfe. But if he haue no conſcience of that ſinne he is guilty of all<note place="margin">Iames. 2. 10.</note> other. Indeed a man by infirmity may faile, and be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining to one ſinne more then to another, but if he haue no ſtrife againſt it nor hatred of it, it is a ſure token that he is guilty of all other ſinnes, and hath no true hatred of any. He confirmeth their faith and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:17926:13"/> loue, by the true end, that there being a true end of<note place="margin">Verſe. 5.</note> them, then their faith and loue are true. The end is ye looke for reward in heauen, without which it were impoſſible your faith ſhould ſtand, and your loue ſhould be ſupported: for there are ſo many aſſaults befalling vnto vs, in this preſent life, which would ouerthrow our faith and quench our loue, vnles it were ſupported by the hope of euerlaſting life. Therefore in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrewos</hi> it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared<note place="margin">Heb. 6. 19.</note> to an Anchor: yet there is difference: for as men caſt their Anchor into the ſea, to be faſtned in the earth, ſo this is faſtned in heauen, that no ſtorme of tentation, or trouble ſhall be able to breake it of.</p>

               <p>Againe, the word is called the Goſpell, the Goſpel is an accompliſhment of all the promiſes of God in CHRIST at his comming, which beganne at Saint <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> for howſoeuer the Prophets and <hi>Dauid,</hi> &amp;c. haue notably and plainely ſpoken of CHRIST, yet that was not the Goſpell, they ſpeaking of things to come, the Goſpell of that which is preſent. To teach vs to conſider what thankefulneſſe wee are bound to render to God, for that mercy and light, that he hath vouchſafed vs by the Goſpell, <hi>viz.</hi> that which <hi>Abraham</hi> and the Fathers and Kings haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to ſee and could not.</p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:17926:15"/>
               <p>The Goſpell is a good newes, and therefore this commendeth it vnto vs, as to bee ſo much the more deſired of vs: And who is it, that naturally is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to heare good newes, and will very much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of it: if not too much; as that it may bee well ſaid of vs, which the Apoſtle ſaith of the <hi>Athenians, Speake againe?</hi> But (alas) how backeward are wee to<note place="margin">Act. 17.</note> enquire of this newes of the Goſpell? we enquire of newes out of <hi>England, France, Spaine,</hi> and other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but how much more ought we to be deſirous &amp; inquiſitiue of the news of our owne country, indeed, which the Goſpell bringeth? for we are but ſtrangers here in this life, and our owne country is in heauen.</p>
               <p>Againe, wee will bee very deſirous to heare other newes which yet may be vncertaine, but this newes of the Goſpell is moſt true and certaine. Further, if good newes come to vs, which is confirmed to vs from all quarters, we reioyce in it, and are the more deſirous of it, and if they ſhould ſay that this newes is not confirmed vnto vs, euen by God himſelfe, and by CHRIST, they ſhould lye, and therefore this newes is to be preferred before all newes. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle proceedes further to proue it to be the truth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Goſpell is come to them, and is preached through all the world.</p>

And therefore it was neceſſary that the word ſhould go throughout the world indeed, but not generally at all times. But if they will haue that to be the Truth and the Goſpel which was Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in the whole world, then theirs is not the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, which was neuer in <hi>India,</hi> nor in <hi>Turkey,</hi> nor in any of the <hi>Greeke</hi> Churches, for the Patriarke of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi> neuer embraced their religion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Goſpell is not the true Goſpell.

For in the time of Popery, they liued in igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in palpable &amp; Egiptiacall darkeneſſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſmall ſinnes could not be ſeene to be ſinnes. Great ſinnes as blaſphemie, infidelity &amp;c. were no ſinnes. For there was no liberty in reading of the word. Now the light of the Goſpell diſcouereth ſinnes that are committed vnder it, which in time of ignorance were not thought nor knowne to be ſinnes. Againe wee wiſh it might bee found more truely; That if the ſinne in time of the Goſpell bee puniniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnder the Goſpell, then the Goſpell is quit and free from that accuſation. Now by the Goſpell, the Goſpell appointeth the ſinnes committed vnder it to be puniſhed, and ſo much the more ſharply, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in the light they haue beene committed. And therfore thoſe, that haue the charge in the common wealth, and the Miniſters are more earneſty to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme that duty more carefully for the credit of the Goſpell. The Miniſters ought to inueigh the more vehemently againſt ſinne and to reproue it out of the word of God, and the Magiſtrates to ſee it more ſeuerely puniſhed. Thirdly our Goſpell is proued in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to be the Goſpell, becauſe that in the Goſpell
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:17926:17"/> ſinnes more brake out then without the Goſpell, which is ſtrange. But the Apoſtle proueth it, for the<note place="margin">Rom. 2.</note> preaching of the Law, which goeth before the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Goſpell, preſſeth (ſaith he) the wicked. And in the wicked it hath this effect, that it maketh them worſe: for thoſe that are truly called are but a few, and a little flocke, and therefore the word muſt haue an effect of condemnation in the greater ſort. Fourthly, but the truth and fruite of the Goſpell doth appeare in thoſe, that are truly called, for in them it bringeth forth holineſſe of life and good workes. And therefore wee be to them, that ſeeing any ſinnes vnder the Goſpell lay it vpon the Goſpell, whereas it is the corruption of men, which is the cauſe of offences and tranſgreſſion and not the Goſpell. And therefore it ſheweth their corruption, which paſſe by thoſe good men, and inſtruments of Gods glorie, the moſt religious and holy men, and will not behold the good things, that are in the Church. But the Apoſtle proceeds further to confirme them more perticularly, that whereas they might haue doubted whether it was the ſame, that was preached to <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and other Churches, he anſwers, it is the very ſame with theirs, which was preached by <hi>Epaphras</hi> their Miniſter. And ſo we may ſay of our faithfull Miniſters, which haue truly inſtructed vs before, that our doctrine now is the ſame, which was preached by them to vs heretofore.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Epaphras</hi> he deſcribeth to be their <hi>Deare fellow ſeruant and a faithfull miniſter of</hi> CHRIST, &amp;c. By that he giueth commendation vnto him, thereby to maintaine the honour and reputation of the Miniſter to his people, that ſo they might be the better per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of his loue.

               <p>The ſumme of theſe three verſes is a prayer, that the Apoſtle doth make for the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> for all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Chriſtian conuerſation, and for all Chriſtian duty whatſoeuer, ſo that in theſe 3. verſes are ſhut
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:17926:18"/> vp whatſoeuer may be required of a Chriſtian man, ſo that the like prayer in ſo few wordes is ſcarſe to be found in the Scripture againe. Wherein theſe two things are to be conſidered, firſt, the cauſe why the Apoſtle prayeth, ſecondly the prayer it ſelfe layd downe in the reſt of the text. For the firſt, for this cauſe <hi>Viz.</hi> becauſe of that for which we haue giuen thanks before, <hi>Viz.</hi> your faith and loue, becauſe that it is wrought aboundantly in you. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctrine </seg>
                  </label> Whence wee learne that thoſe that are called to the knowledge of the truth, and are endued with excellent guiftes, of faith, hope, and loue &amp;c. are they, for whom wee ought moſt eſpecially to pray, and as they are lift vp higher, by the Lord to heauen (as it were) to be as ſtarres to the reſt of the world, by ſo much the more are we to pray for them, that they may ſtand in the truth, and be daylie increaſed in the guiftes of God: And this is a common thing often obſerued and mentioned in the Scripture, that thoſe, whom God hath aduanced with graces, he will be further gratious to them, and therfore we are more to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard them in our prayers. And therfore our Sauiour<note place="margin">Luk. 8. 18.</note> ſaith, thoſe that haue ſhall haue more aboundantly. And the ſame we ſee verified, that he that hath 5. tallants hath gained. 5. more, he that hath gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned 2. hath two more, he that hath one, hauing hid it, and being iudged to haue it taken away, the King commandeth it to be giuen to him that had 5. and<note place="margin">Luk. 4. 19. 24. 26. Iam. 1. 5.</note> they obiect that he hath 5. he anſwers, he that hath, ſhall haue in aboundance. And Saint <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith, God giueth <hi>without vpbrayding,</hi> he giueth without grud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging or repining, or caſting it in their teeth; which receaue of him: for he doth not as men, who hauing beſtowed much on a man, if he come againe, he will
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:17926:19"/> lay it in his diſh, that he hath beſtowed on him all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, this and this, and ſhall he giue him more? but the Lord doth not ſo, but to whom he hath giuen much, he will yet giue more. And therefore the Lord in ſome ſort doth after the manner of men, from whence the prouerbe of our Sauiour is taken, that when men are rich, others will giue great guiftes vnto them: but the Lord doth after a farre other man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: for the Lord feareth none, neither is behoulden to any, as men are to thoſe, that are greater then they,<note place="margin">Reaſons ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing that thoſe. that haue grace, ought eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to be commended to God.</note> and therfore for that cauſe beſtoweth not his guiftes.</p>
               <p>The reaſons why they, that haue receaued graces from God, are more ſpecially to be prayed for, and that thoſe, that are entred into the liſts of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anitie, are principally to be recommended vnto God, are diuers, and worthy to be conſidered. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>1</label> The firſt is in regard of themſelues, for though they haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, yet they ſtill want, and therefore they are not ſo much to regard that they haue, but alſo to regard that they want: for vnles a man doe looke to his wants and corruption, though he haue but one little grace, he will be li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ted vp againſt God and againſt men, and therefore to be prayed for. As we ſee in Poperie, that howſoeuer they haue no guiftes, but naturall and common, yet are they puffed vp in the pride of their hartes, in this regard, that they boaſt they can merit at Gods handes. And therefore we are to conſider that in thoſe, that haue the greateſt guifts, there are great wants, and cauſes of humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for which cauſe they haue need to be pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yed for.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Another reaſon is in regard of other men, leaſt they be lifted vp aboue others: which is done, in that by ſeing our owne weakeneſſes, and infirmities
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:17926:19"/> we may be kept from not being lift vp againſt others, and in regard of their infirmities to contemne them. And therfore the Apoſtle ſaith, if any man be fallen<note place="margin">Gal. 6. 1.</note> by occaſion into any fault, ye which are ſpirituall, reſtore ſuch an one with the ſpirit of meekeneſſe, conſidering thy ſelfe leaſt thou alſo be tempted. And therfore it is neceſſarie, to ſee our ſinnes, that we maybe the more able to beare with the weakeneſſe of others.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly in regard of the enimie, for thoſe that are entred into Chriſtianitie, and are indowed with the graces of God, and are entred into the Goſpell, and profeſſion of God and godlineſſe, the deuill is moſt buſie to preuent the ſame, and to ſow tares by and by after good ſeed is ſowne.<note place="margin">Math. 13.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The Church being with child, that is, deſirous and taking paynes to bring forth Chriſtians, and<note place="margin">Apocal. 12.</note> children vnto God (for it asketh great paynes to beget a Chriſtian) we ſee the deuill is wayting and leering to deuoure them, when they come out, as the kite houereth ouer the chickens, to deuour them, when they are young. So the deuill is ready to deuour the children of God at the firſt when they are young and tender, and new borne: for when they are ſtrong, he doeth not ſo much aſſault them.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, a principall reaſon, why we are to pray for them is, becauſe a Chriſtian by reaſon of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion (as it were) carieth in his forehead that name of God, and therefore the falles of him, more then of any other, doe tend to the diſhonour of God, and are turned againſt God himſelfe. Indeed it is a ſhame that the fall of the ſeruant ſhould be layd vpon the Maiſter, for if a maiſter or father hauing laboured to bring their ſonne or ſeruants vp in the feare of God,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:17926:20"/> it is a ſhame that the fault ſhould be laid on the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent or Maiſter: for we vſually ſay, if one thus brought vp, doe fall in his life, their parents or Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters haue done their part, but he is an vngracious child, or ſeruant. But men doe not ſo to God; for if any of his children fall, they lay it ſtraight and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute it vnto God himſelfe. And therefore we ought the more to pray for them, that are exalted by the Lord, that by their fals the Goſpell of God may not be diſhonoured. And as they are placed in higher place, and are indewed with greater guifts, ſo the more earneſtly we ought to pray for them. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let vs examine whether, when we haue a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter to enter, and come vnto vs, to inſtruct vs, we haue commended him to the Lord, or whether we haue beene thankefull for any bleſſing, that we haue receaued by our Miniſter.</p>

                  </label> We (ſaith the Apoſtle pray) if the Miniſter pray for the peoples increaſe and growing forward, much more ought the people to pray for themſelues, for the going forward in grace, that the good word be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne in them ſhould increaſe, and proceed till it be ripe.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctrine </seg>
                  </label> Thus much of the cauſe, the prayer followeth, for all things neceſſarie for a Chriſtian. All good things whatſoeuer we haue come from God, we haue of our ſelues no knowledge of God, nor of the graces of God, no ſtrength to enter or continew in the wayes of God, but we muſt haue it from God himſelfe, which is proued by the Apoſtles praier: for none pray for that they haue themſelues. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſee here the opinion of the Philoſophers vayne, yet in one part true, in that they held none ſhould pray for that they had, but in that they prayed

                  </gap>t for vertues, becauſe (ſaid they) men haue ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of nature, and therefore they prayed to their gods onely, for thinges of this life. But their opinion is fals, that <hi>any vertue is of nature:</hi> for we haue no<note place="margin">1. Cor. 4. 7. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

But we learne that <hi>whatſoeuer good thing we haue is of God,</hi> eſpecially, which concerne the kingdome of God, &amp; therfore to be often asked of him alone. This ſerueth to confute the error of Popery, who will make our ſelues to haue free will to good, or any good things of our ſelues. And not onely to confute the opinion of Poperie but the practize of Popery in vs ſtill: for though in our iudgement, we nouriſh not that opinion of Popery, but confeſſe, and approue and acknowledge theſe graces proceede from God<note place="margin">Vote.</note> yet in our hearts and practiſe wee nouriſh it: when as we do not vſe the meanes of increaſe: in the graces of God in vs, in praying, in diligent hearing the word, and vſing and frequenting the exerciſes of religion, which is the moſt dangerous thing of all. He deſires firſt that they may be filled with all knowledge: this is the firſt thing in Chriſtianitie, that a man haue knowledge and vnderſtanding; for though a thing be good, yet being not of knowledge, it is euill to him that doth it. This knowledge, is ſet out by two wordes, the one ſignifieth to iudge betweene things, what is good, what euill, what is holy, what propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne. And not onely he requiers to iudge of the things themſelues, but of the meanes which are to be vſed for the doings of men. For men often diſcerne and iudge well the things, but fayle in the meanes: <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi> ſhe beleeued well and iudged well, that there ſhould be a bleſſed ſeed, but ſhe iudged euill, and<note place="margin">Gen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 18</note> fayled in the meanes, for ſhe diſpaired in her ſelfe

So <hi>Rebecka</hi> ſhe iudged well of the bleſſing, which ſhould be to <hi>Iacob,</hi> better then <hi>Iſaac</hi> did, yet of the meanes ſhe iudged not rightly, and therfore abuſeth her husband and maketh her ſonne abuſe him by a lye. Another word is here vſed, which ſignifieth not onely to iudge of the thinges and the meanes but alſo to iudge rightly of the perſons, times, and places with other circumſtances, which is a neceſſary thing in Chriſtianitie. For it is not enough to know of the thinges and meanes to doe them, but of the circumſtances, when, where, and before whom to doe them. As to know to what perſon he is to ſpeake and when &amp;c. As for example. <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale</hi> when ſhe ſaw her husband was drunken, ſhe would not reproue<note place="margin">1.

                     <p>9 For this cauſe we alſo, ſince the day we heard of it, ceaſe not to pray for you, and to deſire that yee might bee ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled with knowledge of his will, in all wiſedome and ſpirituall vnderſtanding.</p>
                     <p>10 That ye might walke worthy of the Lord, and pleaſe him in all things, being fruitfull in all good workes, and increaſing in the knowledge of God.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T hath bene ſaid that of this place are two parts: one the cauſe of the prayer, and ſupplication, that <hi>Paul</hi> and his company did make, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the prayer it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Of the cauſe we haue heard, and ſomewhat of the petition it ſelfe, and thus farre we haue ſpoken of this notable pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, the like whereof in ſo few words is ſcarſe to bee found in the Scripture.</p>
               <p>Hauing vnderſtood what is the firſt point of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity to haue knowledge, &amp; <hi>to be fill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d</hi> with know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which is a Metaphor taken from veſſels, which are filled ready to runne ouer: So the Apoſtle requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth of all men to be <hi>full of knowledge.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Prophet ſpeaking of the time of the Goſpel,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:17926:22"/> ſaith: men ſhall be as the waters, which ſhall euer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorge<note place="margin">Eſay 19.</note> of their waters to the fields. And therefore we may condemne the Church of Antichriſt, which were ſo farre from nouriſhing knowledge, as that the chiefe point of their religion, was to mainetaine ignorance.</p>
               <p>But let vs come to our ſelues, let vs examine whether wee bee able to diſcerne betweene ſweete and ſower, nay, betweene that which hath a ſhew of good, and ill, euill from good, and not onely of the fouleſt and groſeſt, but of the leaſt ſinnes, that wee be able to diſcerne them to be ſinnes: this diſcerning ſpirit muſt be in vs: And we muſt diſcerne betweene good and good alſo, which is more good, which leſſe. And in euill to ſee the leaſt euill, that can bee, which euery Chriſtian ought to do. Indeed the world vſually doth not diſcerne of euill things, &amp;c. but Gods children do: for they looke into the ſinne, as a man into a Chriſtal glaſſe, wherein a man may ſee the leaſt moate: Euen as well, as a man can by his taſt diſcerne meates and drinkes. Indeed in matter of meate and drinke wee can ſoone feele whether it be ſweete or ſower, ſalt, or ill-ſauory, and yet in ſinnes though as great as Mountaines wee cannot diſcerne them.</p>
               <p>This of the firſt point, the next is, <hi>that they walke worthy of God:</hi> this is another point of Chriſtianity and a farre greater, for knowledge indeed is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but with it muſt bee ioined practiſe, without which knowledge is vnprofitable, nay rather hurtful. And it may be ſaid that <hi>a man knowes ſo much in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ephe. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>as he practiſeth,</hi> if yee bee learned any whit in the ſchoole of CHRIST, yee haue learned this, to lay downe the old man, the fleſh and ragges of the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:17926:22"/> old corruption, and put on the new roabes of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſhewing that nothing is learned without pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctize: for when men ſee you practiſe nothing, they ſay you haue learned nothing of the Miniſter. The Prophet, ſpeaking of <hi>Sion,</hi> ſet on a Mountaine, in the<note place="margin">Eſay 2.</note> time of the Goſpell, ſaith: they ſhall exhort one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to go vp, why? To heare: and to what end? to walke in the way, we are taught. So that we are in Chriſtianity to know how we may practize. Indeed in ſome knowledge, as of the Artes, &amp;c. knowledge may bee profitable without practiſe, but in matters of God and godlineſſe, it is nothing, without pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe. The practiſe of a Chriſtian is ſet out</p>

               <p>In generall <hi>to walke worthy of God,</hi> what meaneth the Apoſtle by this, we ſhall conſider better of it by comparing it with other places. The Apoſtle to the <hi>Epheſians</hi> ſaith, <hi>Euery man is to walke worthy of the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ephe. 4. 1. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>whereunto he is called:</hi> and he exhorts the <hi>Phillipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to walke worthy of the Goſpell.</hi> So that this is ſet downe in three ſorts: <hi>to walke worthy of our calling, to</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 1. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>walke worthy of the Goſpell, and to walke worthy of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, <hi>to walke according to the Goſpell,</hi> ſignifieth, to be ſpirituall and holy, as the Goſpell is holy and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, to <hi>walke according to our calling,</hi> is ſpoken by a ſimilitude, taken from men; becauſe in that cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a man is, he will carry himſelfe according to his place. A Gentleman will not walke baſely, as others doe: And a Magiſtrate will doe according to his eſtate, and a Prince likewiſe. And ſhall not the children of God, being called to be children of God,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:17926:23"/> and the ſonnes of the moſt Higheſt, walke as the children of God. And therefore wee ſee it marked on <hi>Dauid</hi> as a reproach, that he did carry himſelfe like<note place="margin">2. Sam. 21. 13.</note> a mad-man, in <hi>Achiſh</hi> his Court. And is it not a ſhame for a Chriſtian to carry himſelfe ſo baſely in ſinne? For ſinne is the vileſt thing that can be, it is a moſt baſe thing to bee a ſlaue to ſinne, there is no drudgery ſo loathſome, which can bee compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, <hi>to walke worthy of God,</hi> here the Apoſtle declareth that hee that maketh light of the Goſpell, maketh light of God himſelfe, and walketh vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of God. It may bee aſked what that worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is? It is ſet forth to bee a walking in all manner of pleaſing of God, if we ſtudy to pleaſe God in euery thing, which is a very notable thing: 1 To pleaſe God, then to pleaſe him in all things which wee know: to do that which wee know may pleaſe God, and to ſet our ſelues againſt any thing that wee know may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe God, for men vſually doe naturally take de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to pleaſe themſelues, and to ſeeke for thoſe things, which may be moſt according to their owne heartes, pleaſant to their owne eyes. And therefore <hi>Salomon</hi> in <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi> ſaith, to the yong man, moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him, <hi>Go to, Reioyce ô yong man in thy youth, and</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccle. 11. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>walke in the wayes of thyne heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another ſort of men walke to pleaſe the world, and care not what they may doe, ſo they may pleaſe thoſe, whoſe fauour they deſire; but <hi>if I ſhould pleaſe</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 1. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>men, I ſhould not bee the ſeruant of God,</hi> ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, And as wee are to pleaſe God, ſo, <hi>in all things wee ought to doe it,</hi> at the leaſt to <hi>wreſtle and ſtriue</hi> with our ſelues to the obedience of Gods will in all things. And if in doing the will of God, the world bee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:17926:23"/> wee need not to care, but to goe forward: For al-be-it the Apoſtle ſaith, as much as wee can with pleaſing God wee are to pleaſe all men, yet<note place="margin">Rom. 15.</note> if wee cannot pleaſe men, but diſpleaſe God, wee are not to care for mens diſpleaſure in regard of Gods: for Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>I care not for mans</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>iudgement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Examine our ſelues, therefore we ought, whether wee pleaſe our ſelues, or the world, more then God, or no.</p>
               <p>It followeth, <hi>Being fruitfull in all good workes,</hi> that<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erſe 10.</note> is, bringing forth euery good fruite; this is the ſame with the former, but it explaineth the other by a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor, if we bring forth good fruite in euery good worke, where hee compareth men to <hi>fruitfull crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> as <hi>ſheepe,</hi> eſpecially bringing forth two lambes, or to <hi>trees</hi> bringing forth good fruite. The chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God are in <hi>Eſay,</hi> called <hi>Okes</hi> of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,<note place="margin">Eſay 61. 3.</note> in that they are ſtrong and ſtand againſt all temptations and tempeſts: And like Okes in ſteadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of profeſſion: So alſo in regard of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent fruite, they are compared to the <hi>Vin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> which is accounted in the Scripture of all trees a moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent tree, and moſt profitable, ſweete, and pleaſant, as alſo plentifull, and therefore in regard of the goodneſſe and aboundance, we are to like of it. And therefore our Sauiour ſaith: <hi>I am the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ine, and my</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 15. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Father the Huſbandman</hi> to dreſſe the Vine. And the Vine is ſingular and moſt excellent in regard of the<note place="margin">Ezek. 15.</note> fruite, for elſe it is good for nothing, not for to make a pin, but for the fire: ſo Chriſtians, which profeſſe God and the Goſpell, if they bring forth no fruite and pleaſe not God, they are the worſt of all men, worſe then the Iewes, Turkes, and heathen, let them
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:17926:24"/> brag what they will of the word, and Sacraments, &amp;c. And they muſt bring forth much fruite, <hi>viz.</hi> in euery good worke, and therefore it is ſaid the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth trimme that Vine, to make it bring forth <hi>more fruite,</hi> It was required alwaies that the children<note place="margin">Iohn 15. 2. Zach. 12. 8.</note> of God, ſhould bring forth fruite, but much more in the time of the Goſpell. And therefore the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſaith, the leaſt, baſeſt, and weakeſt of the people of God, at that time ſhall be as <hi>Dauid,</hi> and he that is as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſhall be as an Angell of God. Wee know how valiant and couragious <hi>Dauid</hi> was, ſo ſhall the weakeſt in the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>To increaſe in knowledge, is another point of<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erſe 10.</note> walking worthy of God, as to bee endowed with the graces of God, ſo to encreaſe (both the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and others) in the knowledge of God, that is, in the knowledge of the will of God, and to bee quicke-ſighted in the ſame. In the beginning of the booke of <hi>Prouerbes</hi> there is a ſaying, which may<note place="margin">Prou. 1. 4.</note> bee referred to all the Scripture. That the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbes</hi> of <hi>Salomon</hi> are ſuch as the leaſt child, that hath wit, and the hardeſt man of capacity, <hi>the ſimpleſt,</hi> may profit by it to knowledge, and there is not the wiſeſt man in the world, but may learne wiſedome thereby, and may wax more wiſe, and ſo it is to bee ſaid of all the bookes of the Scripture.</p>

Sith then it is ſo, let vs ſee what our duty is, for as the Prophet ſaith, the Lord is my lot, my portion, it is a<note place="margin">Pſal. 16.</note> fayer and beautifull inheritance, and hath fallen vnto him in an excellent ground. And ſeing our inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is the ſame with <hi>Dauids,</hi> and as excellent as his was; and yet it is more notably ſet forth 1. <hi>Peter</hi> 2.<note place="margin">1. Peter. 2.</note> That whereas the Iewes were ſcattered from their inheritance into <hi>Pontus</hi> &amp;c. This is now troden downe vnder foot by wicked men, this cannot be ſo. Againe that is faded and decayed, this can neuer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay<note place="margin">1. Peter 5.</note> and periſh, and therfore ſeeing our inheritance is ſo excellent, and ſo precious; whatc are ought we to haue to keepe it and maintaine it? for as we vſe in prouerbe, <hi>It is my free-hold,</hi> and therefore I muſt
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:17926:26"/> looke to it: ſo ſeeing this our free-hold, wee are to haue ſpeciall care, and regard aboue all things to keepe it ſure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He hath fitted vs for this,</hi> wherein he doth plainely teach vs, that there is no readineſſe, aptneſſe, and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in our owne nature, and therfore we muſt haue our fitneſſe from God: A man is fit for his fathers inheritance: but for Gods inheritance we are not ſo, for wee are (euen all the world, in regard of Gods matters) naturally but blind borne. Againe though<note place="margin">Eſay 42. 7.</note> wee had our ſight, yet we are lame and cannot reach ſo much as a hand to it, nor go one foote to it, and haue both theſe naturally, and therefore cannot by vs bee cured, as the blind man ſaid. Againe, which<note place="margin">Iohn. 9. Eph. 2. 1.</note> is more, we are dead in ſinne, and therefore muſt bee new creatures, which wee cannot make our ſelues. And therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, that we are not able<note place="margin">2. Cor. 3.</note> to doe good, becauſe wee are not apt, nor fit to doe good, and therefore what fitneſſe ſoeuer we haue it commeth from God: And this ought to cauſe and ſtirre vs to thankfulneſſe vnto God, as the Apoſtle heere doth. For ſeeing we are both made fit by God for his inheritance, and ſeeing hee hath beſtowed it freely vpon vs, therefore wee are the more carefully to bee thankefull, which wee ſhould not bee bound to doe, if it were of our ſelues, What this inheritance is hee ſheweth in making it conſiſt of two parts.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. Pulling vs out of darkeneſſe.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. Carrying vs into the Kingdome of his beloued Son. (<hi>Pulled vs</hi>) Thereby ſheweth that hee vſeth great ſtrength to deliuer vs, which confirmeth to vs the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine before, of being vnable our ſelues to do. And therefore he deliuers vs, and puls vs out as of a priſon,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:17926:27"/> which are vſually darke. And more notably he ſaith, that he <hi>puls vs out of the pit without water,</hi> ſetting down<note place="margin">Eſay 42. Zach. 9. 11.</note> and comparing this priſon to a pit or dungeon, wherein is onely dirt, wherein wee ſticke, where is no water, where hee deſcribeth our damnable eſtate, for ſeeing we are caſt into ſuch a priſon, but eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly being caſt by God himſelfe, in his iuſt iudgement, how is it poſſible that wee ſhould deliuer our ſelues, and therefore our Sauiour faith: <hi>No man can come to me, but he muſt bee drawne by my Father.</hi> A man may<note place="margin">Ioh. 6.</note> bee in priſon and haue no will nor affection to come out, and therefore it maketh to the glory and praiſe of God, in doing the whole worke of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. And if, after the Church is called to CHRIST, ſhe findeth ſuch dulneſſe and heauineſſe in her ſelfe, that ſhee muſt bee drawne, though they<note place="margin">Cant. 2.</note> haue receiued grace and are drawne out of the pit. How ſhall they haue any ſtrength to get out, which are not yet drawne out of the pit and dirt? So that the firſt part is to be deliuered from blindneſſe, from ignorance, hardneſſe of heart, the wrath and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, and condemnation.</p>
               <p>The ſecond part is the making vs pertakers of his Kingdome, And as the darkeneſſe wee are deliuered from, is partly in this life, and was after to bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, in hell, if we had not bene deliuered: ſo the Kingdome of God is begunne in this life, and is within vs, and ſhall be perfected in heauen after this life: So that wee ſee thoſe, that are the children of God indeed, will in this life endeauor, to giue obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the commandements of God. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though men profeſſe themſelues the ſeruants of God, yet their liues being not according to God, they are no ſubiects of God: For as hee that
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:17926:27"/> will profeſſe himſelfe to bee ſubiect to the King, and yet in his deed will yeeld obedience to the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and ſerue him, hee is doubtleſſe a Traytor. So it is with thoſe, that profeſſe themſelues to bee Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, yet if in their liues and behauiour they do not ſhew forth the fruites of it, they are nothing but Rebels to God, and ſeruants to the diuell, come they neuer ſo diligently to the Word, and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Hitherto we haue heard what theſe two perſons, God the Father, and God the Sonne, haue wrought in our ſaluation. Now followeth the matter of our Redemption, <hi>viz.</hi> in him, <hi>viz.</hi> in his beloued Sonne we haue Redemption, becauſe we haue forgiueneſſe of ſinnes.</p>
               <p>Here is ſet forth in whom, by whom, and in what price wee haue our redemption. For many men will confeſſe that they are ſaued by CHRIST, but when it comes to the meanes there they faile: For the enemies of the truth will ſay that they are ſaued by CHRIST, but yet that they are alſo ſaued by their merite and free-will: and they will ſay that the good workes they haue, they haue of God, and yet they haue no good workes at all, becauſe they haue it not by the meanes which God heere hath laid downe. Our Sauiour CHRIST is hee that hath redeemed vs, and paid the price for vs, and that <hi>wholly.</hi>

               <p>This may be conſidered after this ſort, for ſeeing the Angels themſelues ſtoupe to looke into this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, Wee may by this meane example of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane

               <p>The laſt point ſpoken of out of the beginning of this part we are to conſider further of, <hi>viz.,</hi> touching the Angels, called here powers, dominions, principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities &amp;c. Where we obſerued, that ſeing there is ſuch an order among the Angels, ſuch excellent crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, haue ſome ſuperiours, others inferiours. And for ſo much as Angels are ſubiect to higher Angels, much more ought men to be ſubiect to their Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and Princes, hauing far more need. This was for inſtruction. An other point for conſolation was deliuered vpon this queſtion; whether the bleſſed Angels haue more ſtrenght then the deuils.</p>

The reaſon is, that as men falling from their eſtate loſt much of their wiſedome, wit, ſtrenght &amp;c. Euen ſo the wicked Angels are by their fall diſhabled of that power, and wiſedome, and ſtrenght in compariſon of the bleſſed ſpirits, for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proofe of this reade <hi>Apocalips</hi> 20. 2. One Angel (not ſaid to be an Archangell, or principall Angell, but a meaner Angell) is ſaid to take the dragon, the principall deuill (by the necke as it were) and bind him. For when as the deuill, at the increaſe of the Church, about 30. yeares after the aſcention of our Sauiour CHRIST began to rage mightely againſt the Church of God, and would haue cleane deuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it, had not the Lord laid him on his backe.

And therefore condemnes the Papiſt, which is ſo wretched to take vpon him power to redeeme himſelfe, and to helpe himſelfe to heauen. Nay to helpe others by his good workes, as they call them of ſuper-errogation, or rather to be called of <hi>ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arrogation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But is there any man that by his good workes can create himſelfe, or helpe in any part to the creation of himſelfe? Much leſſe then is a man able to do any thing in the matter of his redemption: As being not able to do any good thing: thus the Lord hath called and regenerated him. And as all the worke of our Creation dependeth on God, as here it is proued, ſo euery part and lot of our redemption is in God, and by God alone.

               <p>One office of our Sauiour CHRIST, as he is the Head of his Church, is to be the Prophet: becauſe as from the head commeth wit and light, to all the members, ſo all inſtruction of the Kingdome of God commeth from CHRIST.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he is the Prieſt, as he is the Head of his Church, becauſe as from the head commeth all the life, and ſenſe by the Arteries: euen ſo by CHRIST, as the Head, all ſpirituall life floweth.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, as the head ruleth all the other parts, ſo CHRIST is King ouer his Church, to rule and gouerne them after his will, ſignifying that whatſoeuer good the Church hath, commeth from CHRIST.</p>
               <p>For this cauſe he is called the <hi>roote,</hi> not the ſprigge of <hi>Dauid,</hi> becauſe, whatſoeuer good thing <hi>Dauid</hi> had, hee receiued from CHRIST.

               <p>He is called the Head of the Church, after, in this Epiſtle, and in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> where it<note place="margin">Ephe. 1. 23.</note> is ſaid to be <hi>his body, euen the fulneſſe of him, that filleth all, in all things,</hi> where is ſet forth the loue of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour CHRIST, that howſoeuer he perfecteth all things, yet he himſelfe is not willing to be perfected without the Church.</p>

And indeed we can neuer in any meaſure ſee the notable redemption of vs by CHRIST, nor can neuer be thankefull vnto God before that be felt of vs. The full man, ſaith <hi>Salomon,</hi> loaths hony, the ſweeteſt thing. And a man though ſicke, yet if he feell not his diſeaſe, will neuer ſeeke to the Phiſitian.</p>
               <p>So it is in our eſtate of ſaluation, that becauſe we<note place="margin">Note.</note> ſee not how lothſome we were naturally, we can not diſcerne the wonderfull glory offered. Hence it was that the Papiſts being filled, with their Merits, Dir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Maſſes, &amp;c. could not ſee the pretiouſneſſe of CHRIST, and therefore ſought not to him.</p>
               <p>And, we, though we are by Gods mercy deliuered from the ſincke of Idolatry, yet we do not wey ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently our redemption, becauſe we do not ſee nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly into our ſinnes, nor behold the vileneſſe of them; indeed we confeſſe in generall we are ſinners &amp;c. but the cauſe of our <hi>Froſenneſſe</hi> is for that we doe not ſee the horribleneſſe of our ſinnes.</p>
               <p>And therfore we are to ſtudie, and to looke dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently into the glaſſe of Gods word, wherein we may ſee our ſinnes in their proper coulors. Indeed if men be once touched with the ſenſe of ſinne by the hand of God, then will they cry, oh the goodneſſe of God! &amp;c. then they will acknowledge it to be the moſt precious thing that is, to be aſſured of the fauour of God. It followeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Strangers: viz.</hi> in regard of the inheritance of God,<note place="margin">Verſe. 21.</note> we haue no lot nor portion with CHRIST, before
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:17926:41"/> our redemption. Againe without CHRIST we are ſtrangers from the Citie of God, from the heauenly<note place="margin">Eph. 2. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and we are vagabonds and rogues from the common wealth of God. Whereas if we be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of CHRIST, we are of the Citie of God, of the heauenly Citie, which came downe from aboue.</p>
               <p>And if to be a Burgeſſe and free Cittizen, be ſuch<note place="margin">Note.</note> an excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t thing, as in the world it is accounted high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: for wee ſee when as <hi>Paule</hi> ſaid he was a Cittizen of <hi>Rome, Liſias</hi> ſaid, <hi>I bought it with a great price.</hi> And<note place="margin">Act. 22. 28.</note> ſaith he, dare you beat a Cittizen. But how much more excellent and precious a thing is it to be a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the heauenly Citie of God?</p>
               <p>Now if we be Citizens of Gods Citie, then folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth an other point, that we muſt be ſtrangers from<note place="margin">Note.</note> the world.

               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:17926:42"/>
               <p>The third word, ſignifieth a man, that cannot be iuſtly brought into iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t before the magiſtrate, or before the Church. Signifying, that a man, not onely may befree fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> great crimes, but euen from all, that may be reprehended by other inferiour men. And here is ment not onely to walke vnblamable before men, but euen before God, to walke vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſincerely. So that ſanctification is the end of our redemption.

               <p>It is a great matter to enter into the profeſſion of CHRIST, and if wee doe not continue, but depart from it, it had bene better we had neuer knowne, nor profeſſed it.

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:17926:47"/> ordained vs theſe meanes of his Miniſters, whereby wee ſhould not periſh.

               <p>Againe, Gen. 9 God hath promiſed after drowning of the world, that the world ſhould neuer be drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and that there ſhould be harueſt to the worlds end: ſhould not men therefore ſow and reape their corne? it is a fooliſh thing to deny it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Acts.</hi> 27. When <hi>Paule</hi> was in danger, the Lord told him that not a man ſhould be loſt: it was moſt true: and the Lord hauing promiſed, would perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me: yet after when the mariners would haue gone away, ſaith the Apoſtle, vnles theſe ſtay we ſhall not be ſafe.</p>
               <p>So that as the Lord hath promiſed, ſo he hath prouided, that <hi>the</hi> things ſhould be effected by meanes.</p>
               <p>For the ſetting forth of this he vſeth two ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, one drawne from a ground or foundation: that as in <hi>Mathew</hi> the houſe founded on the rocke<note place="margin">Math. 7. 24.</note> cannot be ouerthrowne; ſo they that are grounded on CHRIST, by faith, <hi>Mathew</hi> 16. 18. the very gates of hell ſhall not preuaile againſt them. The ſecond ſimilitude is in the word <hi>Setled,</hi> taken from the ſitting of the body, which when it is ſet is more firme, and ſteddy. By which two ſimilitudes he ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth what manner of faith we ſhould haue.</p>
               <p>For the further proofe of this, he vſeth another
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:17926:48"/> reaſon <hi>viz.</hi> if yea be not remoued from the hope of thoſe things, you are in expectation of. So that two things are required: one, that we be not remoued from faith nor leeſe our faith. Secondly that we be not remoued from hope nor leeſe our hope. The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene theſe 2. graces is this. Faith appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends and layes hold on the grace and mercy of God in CHRIST. Hope layeth hold on the fruite of this grace, which is eternall life: and faith regards the word of the promiſe, but hope looks to the thing promiſed. The reaſon then is, that we ſhould abide in the truth, becauſe we looke and hope for euerlaſting life, the bleſſedneſſe laid vp for the children of God.</p>
               <p>If there were no other reaſon, but to abide on the<note place="margin">Note.</note> commandement of God, who commands vs to walke in obedience, nay though we ſhould be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, yet we are to giue obedience to the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements of God. But when as God vſeth this reaſon of alluring vs by propounding euerlaſting life to vs, that ought much more to incourage vs hereunto. Men are naturally bent to deſire honour, riches &amp;c. The Lord here propoundeth to vs the greateſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe that can be, euen in the kingdome of heauen.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 24. Euery man, ſaith the Apoſtle, runs the race, yet but a few, ſhall haue the priſe. But ſeeing there are ſo many rewards in the kingdome of heauen for all that attaine to the end, what a blockiſhnes is it in vs that are ſo dull and dead to runne this race of Chriſtianity?</p>
               <p>Againe, in theſe races they runne for periſhable<note place="margin">Note.</note> things, and they will for a time abſtaine from things, that are pleaſant, and content themſelues with a hard diet, to the end they may runne better and be more light: and ſhall not we therefore abſtaine from, and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:17926:48"/> abridge our ſelues of the pleaſures and profits of this life for the gayning of an incorruptible Crowne in the kingdome of heauen?</p>
               <p>And therefore if we could rightly conſider that when that I leeſe my pleaſure here, and mine honour and wealth &amp;c. if I gaine euerlaſting life in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen, what loſſe haue I thereby? And on the other ſide, if in this life I ſeeke my pleaſure and delight, my credit, welth, honour, worldly prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment &amp;c. and take no care nor paines for the life to come, to be pertaker of the kingdom of God, what a wretched and miſerable caſe am I in? This would make vs more to labour for that which periſheth not, &amp; to contemne theſe world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things in compariſon of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly, and this life in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of that in the world to come.</p>

               <p>And the drift or end of the Apoſtle is to ſtrenghthen the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> and in them all Chriſtians in the continuance in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:17926:49"/> Reaſons wee haue heard before: other fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.<note place="margin">An other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance in the true faith.</note> As namely that the Goſpell, which they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by him, was the Goſpell of CHRIST, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſhould continue.</p>
               <p>And this Goſpell hee proueth to bee the true Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, becauſe it was Preached by his Miniſtery, and of the other Apoſtles, which is confirmed by that of the Prophet, <hi>Eſay 2. That the ſound of them went through all the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſeeing this doctrine was Preached &amp; receiued through al the world, therfore it was the true doctrin of God, for no doctrine but this, had euer, or ſhall haue this ſpreading, No not the wretched doctrine of the Arrians, which were onely in the Eaſt countries: Nor the doctrine of Popery, which neuer went ouer the whole world, for it was not receiued in the moſt parts of the world, no not of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> which are neere, yet ſtood alwaies at ſpeares point with it, and therefore it cannot be the true doctrine.</p>
               <p>And the excellency of the Goſpell of CHRIST is argued to be a wonderful &amp; marueilous doctrine, as being Preached by poore ſilly fiſhermen, and that without any other ſword but of the word, <hi>and of the cenſure and diſcipline adminiſtred.</hi>

               <p>Againe, this ſheweth the wonderfulneſſe of this<note place="margin">Note.</note> doctrine, which is able to pierce and ſting the hearts of men, and to ſubdue the hearts, which is more then all the Emperours of the world could do: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt needes bee the true word of God, which muſt ſo breake into the hearts of men.</p>
               <p>It is no maruell though the doctrine of Popery<note place="margin">Note.</note> was ſo receiued, becauſe it was a doctrine of licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of liuing, ſo many feaſts and holy-daies, ſo many indulgences for any wickedneſſe ſoeuer they

But the doctrine of the Goſpell doth cleane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, it reproueth the euill corruption of nature, and ſubdueth it; And therefore they that haue found this effect by the Goſpell, that it hath ſubdued our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral affections, and conuerted ourformer life to a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it is a notable argument to vs of the truth of this Goſpell.</p>

For the firſt, here ariſe ſtrong arguments of the Papiſts for their doctrine of iuſtification by workes: <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiection. </seg>
                  </label> And one is, they ſay that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſupplyed the paſſions of CHRIST, and therefore his paſſions are not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, but muſt bee peeced and patched with good workes: Secondly, they ſay, the Apoſtle ſuffered for the Church, and therefore the martirdome or merits of Martyrs are to be giuen to Saints for their good.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Solution. </seg>
                  </label> For the anſwere of theſe, we are to know that the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of CHRIST, being ioyned with CHRIST, make but one CHRIST, they being diuers mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of one body, which is CHRIST the Head, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. And as the wife taketh the name of the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, ſo do we of CHRIST being Chriſtians. Now then as our Sauiour CHRIST went before in affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, ſo we are to fulfill his afflictions and to follow him. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. CHRIST abaſed himſelfe that he might make himſelfe like vs in ſuffering, and therefore we muſt bee like vnto him in ſufferings. So that we ſee what an argument they make, that becauſe wee muſt be like him in afflictions, therfore our afflictions muſt merite, nothing leſſe. Another reaſon in that he ſaith: <hi>that which wanted in his afflictions, is ſupplied.</hi> It is ment
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:17926:51"/> in regard of his feeling &amp; ſuffering with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in their afflictions he ſuffereth as before in his owne body, ſo now in the perſon of his Church, and therefore ſaith to <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 9. Saul <hi>why perſecuteſt thou me?</hi>

               <p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Solution. </seg>
                  </label> We are to vnderſtand indeed that the Miniſters of God, and the children of God, when they ſuffer, ſuffer for the Church, not for the <hi>redemption,</hi> but for<note place="margin">Note.</note> the <hi>confirmation, comfort, and example</hi> of the Church, as the Apoſtle ſheweth, 2. <hi>Cor. 1. 6. If wee be afflicted it is for our conſolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp;c.</hi> As if he had ſaid, I ſuffer for your cauſe, that yee ſeeing my afflictions and patience in my trouble might take example to follow mee, and ſeeing my conſtancy through God that doth ſuſtaine mee, yee might receiue comfort and example in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing conſtant your ſelues, &amp; might wade through the afflictions that come vnto you. And therefore we ſee what is the cauſe why the children of God ſuffer, <hi>viz:</hi> for the Churches ſake, by ſtanding conſtantly in the defence of the truth, which Satan eſpecially ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth at, to make them depart from it, and his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts alſo not ſo much look for their life, as the defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the truth: &amp; therfore we continuing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtant in the truth, we are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>querers, how hardly ſoeuer we be delt withall. And therefore wee ſee what ſlender grounds they haue of the doctrin of merits, &amp; indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces which they giue, attributing ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to merits of Saints and Martyrs: Where they alſo deale moſt wretchedly and blaſphemouſly againſt the God of<note place="margin">Note.</note> heauen, &amp; the Son of God, which ſpeake againſt the imputation of the rightouſneſſe of CHRIST to vs, and yet giue that honour to Saints in that they will haue their righteouſneſſe imputed vnto others.</p>

               <p>And therefore in the Epiſtle to the Hebrewes<note place="margin">Heb. 2 17. 18.</note> the Apoſtle ſaith, he himſelfe was afflicted, as that we might be redeemed, ſo alſo that he might haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of our troubles, that ſo he might the more tender vs in our afflictions. As the woman that hath felt the paines of child-birth can tell beſt what it is. So CHRIST himſelfe knoweth our troubles, who hath had the ſenſe of troubles in himſelfe.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle after calleth himſelfe, the <hi>Miniſter</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verſe. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>of the Church,</hi> as before of the Goſpell, both are one. He meanes that he was Gods Miniſter for the edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and comfort of his Church. The end of his Miniſtery of the Church: is <hi>to fulfill the word</hi> of God,<note place="margin">How the word of God is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled.</note> by calling thoſe that are to be called to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth wherein the word is fulfilled, or els fulfilled in hardning the hart of thoſe, that are not to be ſaued: for to them the Miniſtery of the word is to further iudgement, to them, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne it, and profit not by it. In the next words he ſets downe the dignities of Gods word 1. it is a <hi>miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>

                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:17926:52"/> the <hi>Egiptians,</hi> their religion being called a miſtery, and their miniſtry miſticall, or miſteriall men, their religion being hid to the Prieſts alone, who by pictu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res of birds and beaſts had all their religion expreſſed that others might not know it. And therefore we ſee how fitly this ſuperſtition of the Gentils may agree<note place="margin">Note.</note> with the Doctrine of Popery, which will haue the word hidden from the lay people as they called them. Whereas God would haue his will deliuered vnto his ſeruants and people.</p>
               <p>The commendation of the Goſpell then is ſet forth by this word Miſtery, In that it is ſuch an excellent thing as that it can not be attayned vnto by any wit of men and Angels.

               <p>In the two laſt verſes is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended the excellency<note place="margin">Verſe 28 &amp; 29.</note> of his Miniſtery: for if the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> haue a ſufficient Miniſter, then they ſhould co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue in the loue &amp; obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the Goſpel. For me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if they find a hole in the Miniſters coate, they think it is a good cauſe to leaue the Goſpel: And therfore to remoue that obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Apoſtle vrgeth the ſufficiency of his own Miniſtery.</p>
               <p>Here 2 points in our Apoſtles Miniſtery are to be conſidered; 1. his faithfulnes: 2. his care, diligence, &amp; painefulnes. For his faithfulnes it is noted in that he is ſaid to <hi>admoniſh all:</hi> Where we are to note that the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling<note place="margin">Note.</note> of the Apoſtle was an extraordinary calling, whereby he had the field of the whole world to Till. But the Miniſters now a daies haue onely a plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land in one Congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to Till, &amp; therfore that cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ceaſed. Again, herinis the faithfulnes of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, that as al were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mited to him, ſo he cared for al: So is the duty of euery good Miniſter, that euery one
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:17926:55"/> that is committed to his charge, yong, or old, of what ſtate, or conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo ſoeuer, is to be regarded by him.</p>
               <p>Furthermore it is againe to be noted, that hee did <hi>teach</hi> and <hi>admoniſh</hi> them, whereby is meant all thoſe means of ſetting an edge of the Goſpel, that it might peirce and go through, as admoniſhing &amp; rebuking the froward, exhorting of all ſorts, the good by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion: In the doctrine, reproofe, reprehenſion; all theſe are contained in the word admonition: And the word ſignifieth as much, as a laying of any thing to the heart, which is done by all thoſe meanes. So<note place="margin">Note.</note> that we ſee how neceſſary it is to haue the word Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched and applyed, and therefore far be it to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with bare reading. For it is not enough that there be knowledge to enlighte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the vnderſtanding, but that the affections be moued, and the conſcience bee wrought, that men may be with-drawne from euill, &amp; ſtirred vp to good. And therefore thoſe that are reproued, are to yeeld obedience vnto the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe &amp; reprehenſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And the Apoſtle further ſhews that he doth both teach &amp; admoniſh <hi>in all wiſedome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is neceſſary in euery Miniſter, for as the ſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward<note place="margin">Note.</note> is not onely to lay out that, they receiue for the family, but to giue euery one according to their ſtate, ſicke or whole, ſo in the Miniſters.</p>

               <p>In the perſons to be conſidered whether they haue knowledge, that they be gently taught. If they haue knowledge and yet no conſcience, they muſt vſe ſharpe reprehenſion, laying the iudgements of God to wake their ſleepy conſcience. If there be both then vſe partly threats, partly gentle dealing.</p>

               <p>For if men be ſecure, hauing knowledge, then to lay the promiſes of God before them, would harden them more, ſo contrariwiſe in diſpairing.</p>
               <p>Further it is to be conſidered whether they be <hi>children</hi> or <hi>men:</hi> and then they muſt, if they be Babes, haue milke, if ſtrong, they muſt haue ſtronger meat. Further in regard of the ſinnes of the perſons, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider whether publicke or priuate, if priuate at leaſt to a few, if it be publikely reproued it is a want of wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedome; If publike, then publikly, not priuately to be reproued.</p>
               <p>Againe conſider, whether the ſinne be of infirmity or of maliciouſneſſe, if of malice and contempt, it muſt be more ſharply pricked through.</p>
               <p>Thus of the faithfulneſſe of the Miniſter to preach CHRIST, both by the Doctrine, and alſo by the admonition, to giue a point to it, that the Doctrine may enter through.</p>
               <p>We haue alſo heard of the wiſedome of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, The end of all this teaching and admoniſhing is, <hi>to make men perfect,</hi> alluding to the ſacrifices of the Prieſt in the law. For though the miniſter be no ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificer,<note place="margin">Note.</note> as the wretched Papiſts doe make of them, yet there is a reſembla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in the Miniſters to the law, that by the word of God the people are, as it were, killed and cut, to be a fit ſacrifice vnto God: and therefore all this care and wiſedome is to be vſed, that they may be acceptable to God.</p>

               <p>Another ſimilitude he vſeth, that <hi>he ſtriueth,</hi> taken from lawyers and counſellers at the bar, and from ſouldiers with their enemies.

               <p>Laſt of all he ſheweth that the Lord bleſſed his

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:17926:59"/> doth greatly increaſe the affection &amp; care, the eye, &amp; the eare beingthe dores by which pitty enters in. The cauſe wherefore he cared was that they might be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted in ſpirit. Now in ſo much as his care and loue apeared by his writing, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſted of the Goſpel: <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctrine </seg>
                  </label> It ſheweth that there is nothing in the world, that miniſtreth ſound comfort, but the Goſpell. For as for pleaſures, wealth, good-cheare, &amp;c. they bring no ſound co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort, but are like to a flame, that is ſoone out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or ſmoake in the top of the chimny, that ſoone vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth away, or like the fat of lambs, that when a little heate of affliction co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth, melteth. But the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort by the Goſpell ſtandeth by one in all affliction; yea in death it ſelfe, it is a continuall feaſt. And therefore in <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 2. the Kingdome of heauen is compared to a <hi>Feaſt;</hi> yea to a Kings feaſt at the mariage of his ſon, where no delicate fare can bee wanting, but by his commandement will bee brought. So S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith:<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 1. 4. Acts 2. 46.</note> 
                  <hi>This we write that your ioye may be full.</hi> In the <hi>Acts</hi> we reade, that thoſe that were called, <hi>though they were ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of all</hi> yet met together, &amp; participated in eating of meate, and did eate their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon meate <hi>with great ioy.</hi> This is vſual in the <hi>Acts,</hi> that where the Goſpel came, was great ioy and comfort: and therefore when <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> came to <hi>Samaria,</hi> they receiuing the Goſpel, were<note place="margin">Acts 8.</note> comforted. So that that comfort which is in ſin, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery, &amp;c. is wretched, &amp; the beginning of ſorrow, &amp; that which is in lawfull outward things, is but mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentany, But this peace which Chriſt giueth, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant. <hi>My peace</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhall neuer be taken away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt cauſe of this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort that we receiue by the goſpel, is the knowledge of the truth of the Goſpell, as hath bin deliuered in the chap. before: for it is a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort when a man knows which is the word of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:17926:59"/> God &amp; what God hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded, it is a comfort to doe it when he knoweth it is commanded by God, and contrariwiſe it is a comfort, when it is knowne what is forbidden.</p>
               <p>Whereas on the contrary, to the children of God it is a great anguiſh to be ignorant what to doe in Gods ſeruice, and what courſe to take, which might be pleaſing vnto God.</p>
               <p>Secondly not onely knowledge, but perſwaſion, which next followeth, to know that the promiſes ſhall come to paſſe, and the threathings ſhall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, to be aſſured of it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, but eſpecially acknowledgement is mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of moſt ſinguler comfort, when he not onely knoweth and is perſwaded, but applieth it to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: this is notable comfort, for what profit is it to a man to know this is good for him, and hath it not: to be in a dungeon, and to know the Sunne-ſhineth. and yet to haue no light, and to be an hungry and to know there is meat and bread, and yet to haue no part, this is rather matter of greater grief.</p>
               <p>An other cauſe of comfort is <hi>loue,</hi> which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the iointures of the artificers, that when they build any houſe, by the ioints they ſet all the parts together; Or rather to the ioints of the body, wherby euery part being ioined are in peace, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if one be out of ioint, it is a paine to all. So is the ioyning of Chriſtians, by a true louing affection one towards another. <hi>In whom are all the treaſures of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erſe. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>and knowledge hid.</hi> Hauing commended the Goſpell, becauſe it brings wonderfull comfort by wiſedome and knowledge, now he ſheweth where they are to be had, <hi>viz.</hi> in CHRIST, in whom are hid all the treaſures of his father <hi>viz.</hi> touching his
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:17926:60"/> manhood, whereof here it is ſpoken, which is for vs, who from his manhood receiue the graces of God, flowing and running from the head to the ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the garment. And in his manhood are all the graces of God, though not infinitly, yet ſo farre as the manhood can comprehend, perfectly laid vp in CHRIST. For he hath all the graces we haue need of, and therefore the Goſpell hath all, ſo as here is a conuerſe reaſon, for CHRIST hath all, therefore the Goſpell hath all, and contrary, the Goſpell hath all the graces of God neceſſary for vs, therefore CHRIST hath all. For whatſoeuer the Goſpell hath, CHRIST hath, and we receiue from him by the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>This confuteth the Papiſts, who will haue vs to haue any thing from cannons, decrees of Popes &amp;c. But the Apoſtle ſaith that the Goſpell hath all wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and vnderſtanding becauſe it hath them from CHRIST.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hidde.</hi> Which ſheweth that theſe graces of God are hid from all creatures, yea from the Angels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and therefore they labour and bend, euen with paine (if it were poſſible) ſtooping to ſee into theſe myſteries.</p>
               <p>This ſecret and hid wiſedome of God we ſee in this. For 1. it ſeemeth a ſtrange thing that all men ſhould fall and become the membres of Satan, and yet that out of Satans hands he would take his children, this was a ſtrange thing, and a wonderfull miſtery, and wiſedome, to ſhew his loue to them the more 2. It is a ſtrange and a hid thing that God ſhould giue his Sonne to dye, yet it is a ſinguler miſtery, to ſhew the hatred of ſinne, and loue of his children, that he abaſed his ſonne for their ſake.</p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:17926:60"/>
               <p>3. Againe it is a ſtrange thing, that God ſhould ſuffer his children to be afflicted in this life, and the wicked to haue eaſe and peace; and the godly to go to heauen, by hell, to honour, by diſhonour &amp;c. But it was that they might know their owne infirmities, and alſo the better haue a feeling of the comforts, that it might be the ſweeter. 4. Againe, a great miſtery that the Lord, to the building of the excellent worke of the Church ſhould chooſe ſuch weake inſtruments, and ſuch poore meanes, as fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But it is that in their weakeneſſe his power might be manifeſt. 5. Againe it is a ſtrange miſtery in the manner of the deliuery of the Goſpell, not in eloquence of men, but in a plaine ſtile, that as well the Maid at the mill, as the Prince in the Throne might vnderſtand it. But it was that none might im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute it to the excellency of the tongue.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E haue heard how the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle hath entred into the commendation of the Goſpell by many proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and effects in it. And laſt we heard that it is matter of ſinguler com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort vnto the people of God. And alſo that it is a miſtery hid in all ages, and in this, but onely to the children of God.</p>
               <p>There we haue handled that it is a perfit doctrine leading vs the right way whither the Lord calleth vs. For in the Goſpell of our Sauiour CHRIST is laid vp vnto vs all the treaſures of wiſedome and knowledge being onely found in him. And therefore the Apoſtle 1. Cor. 2. would be knowne of nothing<note place="margin">1. Cor. 2. 2.</note> amongſt Gods people, but of CHRIST and him crucified, and therfore in him are all the treaſures of wiſedome and knowledge hid: And the woman <hi>Iohn</hi> 4 ſaith, the <hi>Meſſias</hi> ſhall tell vs all things, which
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:17926:61"/> our Sauiour CHRIST confirmeth: ſaying, <hi>I am hee:</hi> And therefore <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. hee profeſſeth that hee had taught to his Diſciples the whole will of God. And 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. what the Apoſtles receiued they gaue all to the people, and therefore all wiſedome and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is hid in our Sauiour CHRIST, and reueiled to vs in the Goſpell, whereby he is brought vnto vs. And therefore this is a notable commendation of the Goſpell, which is able to perfect a man of God, who<note place="margin">2. Tim. 3. 17.</note> is to teach the people the will of God. And if the word of God is able to make perfect a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, then much more the people, it being needfull that he ſhould haue more then they. Which hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth by the effect, that the duty of the Miniſter is to teach the truth, and confute errours, which the word will perfectly miniſter vnto him. And further to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort the good, reproue corruptions, and dehort from that is naught. And therefore howſoeuer the Papiſts will not deny that it is a perfect word, yet wil they haue the Canons of Councels, &amp; decrees of me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. But the perfection of the word appeareth heere to haue no need of mans inuentions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is hid) viz:</hi> in CHRIST who is the boſome of his Father, and therefore onely can reueale the will of God his Father.</p>
               <p>And howſoeuer a naturall man cannot deny the truth of the Law, yet not <hi>Adam</hi> himſelfe in his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency was able to ſee the myſtery of the Goſpell, nor the Angels themſelues, though more excellent, yet could not without ſeeing and ſtooping to behold it, vnderſtand this ſecret Myſtery.</p>
               <p>Here the Apoſtle incerteth an exhortation: <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take heed that no man deceiue you, with probable and likely ſpeach:</hi> which may ſeeme at the firſt to haue a
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:17926:62"/> faire ſhew. For this is a myſtery and hid thing, and therefore not ſeene at the firſt: Yea oftimes it comes to paſſe, that a lie is more probable and likely to be a truth, then the truth it ſelfe. Example.</p>
               <p>The fruite that groweth now in <hi>Sodom</hi> hath a more excellent ſhew then other fruit, and yet come to feele it, it goeth to froth &amp; wind, &amp; that loathſom. Againe, in gold, before it be tryed, that which is not gold may haue a greater coulour and ſhew then the true gold. And therefore men are not to look vnto the eloquent words and fine ſpeeches, and that men carry the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter away ſmothly, without any regard of the ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the matter: For hence it commeth to paſſe that men are led away into errour: And the danger is not onely when falſe doctrine is deliuered, as here it was, but euen when falſe doctrine is not deliuered, as among the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> where they did only with elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent &amp; braue words mount aloft in their eloque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. And therefore the Apoſtle doubteh not to call them falſe Apoſtles: For when as men reſpect the wordes, and haue little reſpect vnto the matter, and are led away by euery wind of doctrin, there is a ſeduceme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. The Apoſtle then teacheth vs, that no mans learning, authority, eloquence, ſhould draw vs to beleeue that is ſpoken. For not onely eloquence, but authority, &amp; honour doth carry vs vſually away. But the Apoſtle ſaith, let no man deceiue you: and therefore <hi>Gal. 1. Though an Angell from heauen Preach any other doctrine let him be accurſed:</hi> or after any other way: for as the matter which he Preached, <hi>viz:</hi> the Croſſe of Chriſt, is low and baſe in appearance, ſo muſt the manner of the deliuering of it bee.</p>

                  </label> 
                  <hi>Obiect.</hi> Whereas the Apoſtle had ſpoken of his care, ſtrife, and wreſtling for them, they might ſay
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:17926:62"/> that he had no ſuch care as he pretends, becauſe hee neuer came to them. This ſecret obiection he anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,<note place="margin">Solution.</note> that he is alwaies preſent with them, which hee doth by a diſtinction of preſence, <hi>viz:</hi> not bodily, but a ſpirituall preſence. Which ſpeech is vſed to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 6.</note> who reprouing them for that being bodily preſent, did ſuffer the inceſtuous perſon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out excommunicating him: and therefore ſaith, <hi>I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in ſpirit do bid that he ſhould be excommunicated.</hi> This<note place="margin">Note.</note> preſence is not in regard of the ſubſtance of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, for that is in the body, &amp; cannot be in two places, no not the Angels, though nimble and ſwift, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God is in all places. And therefore is meant, by the ſpirit, that he is preſent with the faculties of his mind, <hi>viz:</hi> in vnderſtanding their eſtate, and in his affection and will, <hi>viz:</hi> his loue and care.</p>
               <p>So that wee ſee the preſence of the children of God is other then the preſence of other men, euen with thoſe they neuer ſaw, if they be in good eſtate, to vnderſtand and reioyce, and praiſe God for it: If they be in diſtreſſe to grieue and mourne for them, &amp; to pray for them. Let vs then examine our ſelues, why we deſire to heare for newes out of other countries? Is it for this end? We ſee <hi>Nehemias</hi> being at the Kings<note place="margin">Neh. 1. 2. 4.</note> Court, when men came from <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> by reaſon of the wicked, which troubled the people, he asked how the Church of God did, &amp; vnderſtanding the miſery of it fell to faſting: So are we to do; to enquire of the Churches of God, to the end, that wee may reioyce for their good, or be ſorrowfull for their euill.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reioycing:</hi> Seeing by the eyes of his mind and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering<note place="margin">Verſe 5.</note> their good order he reioyſed: So that the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and ſeeing, is in the minde, which muſt go before reioyſing in the will and affections which
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:17926:63"/> proceedeth from it: So that we ſee that howſoeuer the children of God, haue many cauſes of ſorrow, yet they haue more occaſions of comfort, then the wicked haue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Good order; viz:</hi> the good gouernment and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Church, as is the diſpoſition of an army: So that in that they had a good order in the Church, it did his heart good: And then, in that it is ſaid to be ſet and diſpoſed as an Army, therein alſo is further matter of reioycing. So that here we ſee in a Church is matter of ioy, when the gouernment of the Sonne of God is there, and alſo when it is practiſed: So that where the order of our Sauiour CHRIST is not, there can bee nothing but confuſion, and diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. <hi>Moſes,</hi> though a man inſtructed in the will<note place="margin">Numbers 1.</note> of God would not himſelfe giue anſwere concerning the peoples comming to ſacrifice, yet would not himſelfe giue order vnto them.</p>
               <p>And we ſee, becauſe the Arke of God was carried in a cart, not by the Prieſtes, which the Lord had appointed, the plague beganne to breake on the people.</p>
               <p>Againe, when as the Arke did ſhake, and <hi>vzzah</hi> being but a Leuite, not a Prieſt, did but touch the Arke, which none but the Prieſtes might doe, yet becauſe hee brake the Lords order, is ſmitten with death.</p>
               <p>Heere wee ſee what Church is a happy Church, <hi>viz:</hi> that which hath the doctrine and word of God, &amp; the Sacraments ſincerely deliuered &amp; adminiſtred. After the Apoſtle hauing ſpoken of his own cre, he commeth to the care of the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> exhorting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as they had receiued, ſo they walk in that they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued. Two things then are neceſſary, <hi>viz:</hi> what wee
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:17926:63"/> receiue, <hi>viz.</hi> not the doctrine of Antichriſt inſted of the doctrine of CHRIST, not the doctrine of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in ſtead of the truth. And ſecondly that hauing the doctrine of truth that we walke in it.</p>
               <p>Walking being an ordinary ſpeech in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. <hi>viz.</hi> as a wayfaring man not to ſit ſtill, or goe backeward, but to goe forward in that way.</p>
               <p>The manner of walking is, firſt that they be <hi>rooted,</hi> and ſecondly that they be <hi>knit, viz.</hi> that they be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and ſtedfaſt: before in the former chapter he ſaid that they ſhould be ſetled, which cannot be eaſely moued, and to be grounded.</p>
               <p>Here he vſeth two other excellent ſimilitudes, firſt to be rooted, taken from trees, not like to reeds ſhaken with the wind, but like the Cedars, or as in <hi>Eſay</hi> the Okes, which cannot be remoued. And our eſtate, if rooted in CHRIST, is farre better then the tree, where as if we be not truely grounded<note place="margin">Note.</note> in CHRIST, our condition is worſe then the tree: for the tree being cut will ſpring vp againe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing planted to an other plant will grow againe, but as one of the friends of <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith, if they be once gone and remoued, they neuer riſe againe.</p>
               <p>But the children of God can neuer be diſplanted,<note place="margin">Eph. 1. 4</note> being ſet before the beginning of the world in Gods<note place="margin">2. Tim. 2. 19.</note> election, which is a ſure foundation neuer to be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and confounded.</p>
               <p>And he ſaith <hi>built, viz.</hi> grounded on CHRIST,<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erſe. 7.</note> and therfore ſhall neuer be ſeperated from him. Whereas if we be not built on CHRIST our cauſe<note place="margin">Ezech. 18.</note> is more miſerable. It muſt be ſtedfaſt by faith in CHRIST.</p>
               <p>So that one quality, is, to be grounded and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant: Another is that we abound, <hi>viz.</hi> not ſtand at
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:17926:64"/> a ſtay, but it is required that we runne ouer, as a veſſell filled to the top. So that we ought not onely, not be drawne away by euery wind of doctrine, but we ought to increaſe in grace; and therefore our eſtate is compared to the eſtate of a man, that is firſt a child, then a yong man, then in the perfect age.</p>
               <p>Laſtly is ſet downe thankfulneſſe to God for the benefits receiued, and therfore we ſhould not be forgetfull of them, but cary them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in remembrance: which thanck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe muſt appeare by our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in walking in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of God, and in the continuall practiſe of our loue to God, and to our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</p>

               <p>He biddeth them take heed of <hi>Phyloſophy,</hi> which is a glorious name, ſignifying the loue of wiſedome. But the Apoſtle doth not take away the vſe of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy. For if it be well vſed, it is a good <hi>hand-maid</hi> for to help the Miniſters, if ſo be it be not vſed to
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:17926:66"/> make a gloſe, and a ſhew to the world. But here that Phyloſophy is condemned, which repugneth the<note place="margin">Note.</note> word and Goſpel of God, for ſo far forth as Phyloſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy will as a hand-maid wait and attend on the word of God to further the Miniſters, ſo long it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, and a good help to further the Miniſters in the word of God.</p>
               <p>But when as Phyloſophy doth riſe vp to go hand in hand, or as <hi>Hagar</hi> to her Miſtris, to goe before the word of God, then it is to be condemned, and caſt out. And the reaſon, that Phyloſophy is to be taken heed of, is by reaſon that there is deceit in it, as we ſee in naturall Phyloſophy, that <hi>Ex nihile-nihil</hi> fit, of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing nothing is made.</p>
               <p>This is contrary to the word of God. Againe in morall Philoſophy. They ſay that if there be not free will, why ſhould there be puniſhment, but this is to be taken heed of. This condemneth them, which to excuſe their mingling of the word with Philoſophy, they ſay they doe but as the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did, which rob <hi>Egipt</hi> of her Iewels, or be as <hi>Moſes</hi> who was skilfull in all the learning of <hi>Egipt,</hi> as the ſchool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Papiſts &amp; others doe. But they doe nothing but rob them of their botches and biles. The reaſon that Philoſophie doth deceiue is, becauſe it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth from the braines and inuention of men.</p>
               <p>An other thing the Apoſtle willeth them to take heed of, is, of the elements of the world, which were the traditions of God. For might they ſay if you will not haue vs to deale with the inuentions of men, will ye deny that we ſhould vſe the decrees of God, as the traditions of the law? Here we ſee whom the Apoſtle had to doe with all, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as ioyned with the Goſpell the inuentions of men and Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:17926:66"/> and the ceremonies of the law. The ſame doe we deale withall, <hi>viz.</hi> the Papiſts: for though they confeſſe CHRIST &amp;c. yet becauſe they ioyne the traditions of men &amp; ceremonies which the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell will not admit, therfore we are not to ioine with them, but to oppoſe againſt them, as the Apoſtle did.</p>
               <p>The reaſon why the Apoſtle ſheweth they ſhould not be bound vnto the traditions of the law: Becauſe the ceremonies of the law are the elements, as it were the <hi>A. B. C.</hi> wherein children are to be taught. Now it is no point of a good ſcholler to be alwayes in the <hi>A. B. C.</hi> ſo we muſt not alwaies be babes in Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, for thoſe were the ſhadowes of that truth, which now is, and therefore theſe are the dayes of reſtauration, and perfection.</p>
               <p>Now then if we muſt not haue theſe ceremonies, which God had appointed, but that CHRIST muſt be preached ſimply and barely without ceremonies: much leſſe are we to vſe the traditions and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of men, which the Papiſts religion doth wholly conſiſt of. Indeed there is a doctrine in the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the law, which is perpetuall, but the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies themſelues is at an end.</p>
               <p>Perſwading them not to be caried away by falſe doctrine he ſheweth perticulerly what: <hi>viz.</hi> Philoſophy, and the elements, and in ſumme what ſoeuer is not according to CHRIST: now he rendreth the reaſons, why they ſhould take heed, firſt, becauſe they ſhould be mad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> a prey: To whom?</p>
               <p>1. To thoſe, that deceiued them: Secondly then to Satan: and therefore they had need to watch, for if a man feare his houſe ſhall be rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, will he not watch? then much more ought
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:17926:67"/> we to take heed and watch, leaſt we be a prey to theſe enemies.</p>
               <p>For as when the Romans in triumph hauing their captiues, lead them at their chariots tailes, ſo if we be deceiued, we are led at the tailes of thoſe, yea of the deuill himſelfe, and as our Sauiour ſaith, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 10. the theefe cometh to make a ſpoile.</p>
               <p>Another reaſon, to be wary, becauſe they are not according to CHRIST.</p>

               <p>And therefore we may know the Papiſts are deceiuers, which bring in traditions not according to CHRIST.</p>

               <p>Another office of the Prieſt is to pray for the people, and therefore they that bring in any other interceſſor is contrary to CHRIST.</p>
               <p>Againe it is the office of CHRIST to be King ouer his Church, to command, and giue lawes, and therefore the doctrine of the Pope to to be head of the Church, to giue lawes, to rule, command &amp;c. is a falſe doctrine.</p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:17926:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>The reaſon why CHRIST is ſufficient is, becauſe the whole God-head is in our Sauiour CHRIST, yea the God-head of our Sauiour CHRIST is real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in CHRIST, and therefore hee is onely able to furniſh vs of all: and therefore wee neede not any points of Phyloſophy, or any ceremonies of the Law, to giue ſupply.</p>
               <p>Here the Apoſtle dealeth as a good Teacher, that there being a controuerſie betweene the falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets &amp; him, they aleage one thing, he aleageth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Now to confute them, he taketh a third thing wherin both agreed: So he doth alſo to the <hi>Athenians:</hi> For if he had aleaged the Prophets, they would haue made a mocke of him, and therefore he taketh one of their owne Poets. This is to be practiſed of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the word.</p>
               <p>Heere then the Apoſtle proueth that wee are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed in CHRIST, For hee is made vnto vs<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1.</note> wiſedome, righteouſneſſe, ſanctification, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and therefore hee is our whole accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment, what then need we to ſeeke for any more or any other portion?

                  <hi>God is my lot, my portion, and inheritance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if any bee asked, if they will haue an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, will they not haue it in a faire ground? they will ſay, yea: Then ſeeke it in CHRIST. This then ouerthroweth the going to Saints or Angels, to <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> or the Virgin. For though it were true, that go to <hi>Peter</hi> thou ſhalt not leeſe, if to the Virgin thou ſhalt not leeſe, which yet is moſt ſalfe; for they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help vs: But though it were ſo, that we might haue one peece in one, an other in an other, ſhould we not rather go to CHRIST, where all our inheritance is laid together?</p>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:17926:68"/>
               <p>Laſtly, hee is <hi>aboue all Principalities) viz:</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer in his baſe eſtate hee humbled himſelfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath the Angels, yet he is the Head of them all, and aboue all Angels and Arch-angels, ſo that none of them are able to croſſe his will, or controule him in his Kingdome.</p>

               <p>Secondly, of the notable fruits and benefites ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to vs in theſe Sacraments.</p>
               <p>Heere we are to conſider of the order of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle according to the cuſtome of the Scripture. For the Scripture vſeth to ſet the handling of thoſe laſt, which were named firſt, and the handling of thoſe things firſt, which were named laſt, and therefore the Apoſtle hauing ſpoken of, &amp; named Phyloſophy firſt, and then of the rudements and ceremonies: hee firſt ſpeaketh againſt the ceremonies of the Law, and becauſe circumciſion was moſt ſtood vpon, and chiefly regarded, therefore the Apoſtle doth ſpeake of circumciſion.</p>
               <p>For circumciſion was eſpecially commended in the Law, as that which was performed by all, and was appointed as a badge vnder the Law, to diſtinguiſh the Church of God from the world, and therefore they that were not circumciſed, were abominable, as <hi>Moſes</hi> was in danger for his ſonne vncircumciſed:
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:17926:70"/> 
                  <hi>Exod</hi> 4. 24. Againe, becauſe the circumciſion was 400. yeares before the Law was, and therefore they thought it ſhould not be aboliſhed with the Law. But the Apoſtle anſwereth that we are, and neede not to be circumciſed, becauſe CHRIST was circumciſed for vs, hauing no cauſe for himſelfe to bee circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Now circumciſion is a note of pollution, but we are clenſed in CHRIST. And a man is not to bee circumciſed twice, but once wee are circumciſed in CHRIST, and therefore neede not to bee circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed againe. Further, we haue Baptiſme in ſteed of Circumciſion, and therefore it is not belonging vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs.</p>
               <p>Againe, he maketh two kinds of Circumciſions, outward and inward: The inward is the circumciſion of the heart: <hi>The Lord circumciſeth the heart, &amp;c.</hi> And<note place="margin">Deut. 10. 31.</note> therefore the Iſraelites bragged of this, that they were the circumciſed of the Lord; this is our boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting that the Apoſtle ſaith: <hi>We are glad of this, that</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>the hardneſſe of our heart is taken away, our reioyſing is the circumciſion of the heart.</hi>

               <p>So alſo there is two ſorts of Baptiſmes, for which cauſe the Apoſtle ſaith: <hi>Among the Principles of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, wherein euery one is to bee inſtructed,</hi> nameth the doctrine of Baptiſmes <hi>i.</hi> inward, and outward; for as the Circumciſion was inward and outward; And therefore it is that <hi>Stephen</hi> according as the Prophets<note place="margin">Acts 7.</note> vſed, vpbraided them: <hi>Oh yee ſtiffe-neeked and vncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed:</hi> becauſe though they were circumciſed in body, yet not in heart.</p>
               <p>It were a ſtrange thing, if a man ſhould ſay, men<note place="margin">Note.</note> now that haue come to Baptiſme, that they are vnbaptiſed, and to thoſe that come ordinarily to the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, that they neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:17926:70"/> it, and to thoſe that come to heare the word and prayer, that they neuer did it, <hi>viz:</hi> they neuer effectually did it, in regard that they haue not done it in heart, in that they haue not forſake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their vnclea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and looſeneſſe of life.</p>
               <p>Nay rather it may be ſaid of them, that they haue<note place="margin">Note.</note> receiued the Sacraments, as ſeales of condemnation, and the word as a teſtimony of their iudgement, and prayed to pull the vengeance of God vpon their heads: And therefore wee are to looke, that as they haue the outward, ſo we labour and feele to haue the hand of God inwardly in reforming vs, and renuing vs, and working grace in our hearts.</p>
               <p>The fruite of Circumciſion and Baptiſme, is the putting off the body of ſinne. It is the vſe of the Scripture to compare ſinne to filthy garments, or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, <hi>Apoc 3. Buy of me garments to couer thy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe:</hi> So it is with vs, that if we haue not the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe off CHRIST, we are naked, or elſe clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with the ragges of ſinne: And therefore as men are aſhamed to come into the preſence of others na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked or in filthy ragges. For as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> might not come<note place="margin">Gen. 4. 14.</note> before the King, before his priſon clothes were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off. And are we not to be much more aſhamed, to come into the preſence of the Lord in our ſinnes, which are farre more loathſome to God, then any filthy ragges to man?</p>
               <p>Againe our ſtate of Chriſtianity is compared to a<note place="margin">1. Cor. 9.</note> race, which was vſed among the <hi>Romans,</hi> where in their exerciſes, to the end they might be more light to runne the race better, or to do any other exerciſes, they vſed to put of their cloths, ſo far as with honeſty they might, that they ſhould be no burden or hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance vnto them: Euen ſo ſin being a greater burden
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:17926:71"/> then any clothes to hinder our race, is to be caſt off.</p>
               <p>By fleſh the Apoſtle meaneth the naturall and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall corruption, <hi>viz:</hi> the proaneſle and readineſſe to all naughtineſſe, and vntowardneſſe, and vnfitneſſe to any thing that is good.</p>
               <p>And by the body is ment the fruite of it.</p>
               <p>By fleſh is not meant that the creature it ſelfe is this filthineſſe, for that is a creature (for then CHRISTS fleſh could not be pure) but it is meant the ſpiritual corruption and infection in the body and ſoule ioyned together.</p>
               <p>In that ſinne is called the body of ſinne, it noteth,<note place="margin">Note.</note> that euery one hath in him, or about him, <hi>A Body of ſinne:</hi> So that looke how many members of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy euery man hath, and how many powers of the ſoule, ſo many inſtruments of ſinne: it noteth that whatſoeuer part or facultie is in a man naturally, is nothing but a lump of ſinne, his hand a hand of ſinne, his foote, eie, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Therefore chapter 3. <hi>mortifie your earthly members of ſinne,</hi> filthineſſe, vncleaneſſe, noting that vntill our members bee mortified and renued, they are members of ſinne and vncleaneſſe: Yea they are <hi>wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of vnrighteouſneſſe,</hi> which vntill they bee purged<note place="margin">Rom. 6.</note> and cleanſed, tend onely to the hurt either of our ſelues or others.</p>
               <p>Here then we may know that we are truely bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and haue the true circumciſion of our Sauiour CHRIST, if wee daily labour more and more to cut off the members of ſinne in our ſelues, whereas if we continue in ſinne, and go on more and more in our ſinnes after Baptiſme, then wee may aſſure our ſelues, we haue no part in CHRIST, and our Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme is not profitable.</p>

For the properties of the thing ſignified, is often giuen to the ſeale: As in the Lords ſupper the name of the ſigne, bread and wine, is giuen to the thing ſignified, which is the body and blood of CHRIST. And baptiſme is called the waſhing away of ſinnes, for as water waſheth the filthineſſe of the body, ſo doth the blood of CHRIST, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the water, waſh away our ſinnes. So here to be buried is giuen to baptiſme, which is onely the worke of the ſpirit of God by faith in. CHRIST, which doth bury ſinne in vs.</p>
               <p>Baptiſme doth repreſent our buriall vnto ſinne, becauſe, though it be not vtterly killed, ſo long as we liue, yet it is weakened. In the <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. it is ſaid that we are dead, buried, and raiſed vp in baptiſme, <hi>viz.</hi> baptiſme ſealeth all theſe vnto vs.</p>
               <p>But it is to be obſerued. That he <hi>maketh choiſe</hi> of the buriall onely, rather then the death, to

               <p>For as men may ſeeme to be dead, which are not ſo indeed, but if they be dead and couered, then we are aſſured they are dead indeed, ſo true mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is here ſignified to be a true hatred of ſinne.</p>
               <p>And that was in times paſt notably ſet forth by the cuſtome in the primitiue Church, their <hi>deſcending</hi> into the water, which ſignifieth <hi>death</hi> to ſinne, and <hi>remayning</hi> in the water, their <hi>burying</hi> to ſinne, and <hi>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing</hi> out of the water, <hi>riſing</hi> to righteouſnes. So that here is ſhewed what ought to be true mortification.<note place="margin">A ſimile.</note> For there may be ſome in a ſwone or trance, which ſeeme to be dead, &amp; yet reuiue againe, ſo there are many, that thinke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues dead to ſinne, if they can abſtaine fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome ſinne they haue vſed before, &amp; doe ſome good things they did not before, yet it doth not follow that they are therefore mortified: for they may doe it for ſome ſiniſter cauſe, for hope of gaine &amp;c. and after fall to it againe: and therefore it is neceſſary that there be a <hi>burying viz.</hi> that for conſcience to God, for the feare of God, and loue of him, that he hath bene mercifull vnto vs, we mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie ſinne and walke in holineſſe of life, to continue in it, which mortification importeth.</p>

               <p>Againe, if the children be vnbaptiſed, it is not<note place="margin">Note.</note> theirs, but their parents ſinne, and ſhould it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for the parents cauſe?</p>

               <p>The purpoſe of the Apoſtle is that becauſe that the ceremonies of the Law generally are done away by the death of our Sauiour CHRIST, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ceremonies, which the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of, are done away.</p>
               <p>Here we are to note firſt, the power of the death of our Sauiour CHRIST in taking away ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies; ſecondly, the applying of that effectually to the perticuler eſtate of the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> that they were in by reaſon of falſe Teachers.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, the vſe of ceremonies of the law were<note place="margin">Sundry vſes of the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.</note> diuers. 1. To make a partition wall and ſeperation betweene Iewes &amp; gentils, that neither ſhould come one to other, till it ſhould be taken away. 2. Another vſe in them was to traine vp the Iewes being <hi>children,</hi> in the principles of religion.</p>
               <p>Another vſe here mentioned that they were a hand-writing, teſtimony, and a witneſſe vnto the people of their ſinnes, that they were bound vnto God.</p>
               <p>For what meaneth their manifold waſhings, but<note place="margin">Note.</note> that they were excedingly <hi>filthy,</hi> and loathſome in the ſight of God. And what was the killing of the beaſts and ſacrifices, but to confeſſe, that themſelues were worthy to be ſlaine by reaſon of their ſinnes? further their circumciſion, which they bragged ſo of, did note the vncleanes of the whole man, becauſe out of that part came the ſeed, which proceded from euery part of a man, and therefore all theſe were teſtimonies of the wrath of God due to them.</p>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:17926:75"/>
               <p>But the benefit we haue in our Sauiour. 1. our ſinnes are taken away. 2. The hand writing is not onely blotted out but cancelled, for the ſame nayles, that went through his hands, perced the hand-wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and ceremonies.</p>
               <p>And therefore what iniuries ſhould we doe to our ſelues, and what iniury to our Sauiour CHRISTS death if we ſhould hold the neceſſity of them? For what is he, that hauing the det payd, will not labour<note place="margin">Note.</note> by all meanes to haue the writing cancelled?</p>
               <p>Now it were a farre more fooliſh thing if the detter, when he had payd the det, would deſire his creditor to keepe the bill ſtill.</p>
               <p>And this was not onely the ſinne of the Iewes,<note place="margin">He meanes (I take it) ſuch ceremonies as are vrged as neceſſarie and parts of Gods worſhip.</note> but now it is the fault of them, and farre greater, which will haue ceremonies in the Church, not Gods, but mans ceremonies, which are farre worſe.</p>

               <p>Another reaſon the Apoſtle rendreth, is for that our Sauiour CHRIST hath vanquiſhed the Deuill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Prince of Diuels, called Powers and Principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities: For they were created ſtrong and haue not<note place="margin">Ephe. 2. 2.</note> loſt much of their ſtrength. This is taught by our Sauiour CHRIST <hi>Math.</hi> 12. The <hi>ſtrong man,</hi> that is the Diuel, keepeth the houſe till a ſtronger co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth, which is our Sauiour CHRIST. When our Sauiour was vpon the Croſſe, the Diuell aſſaulted him moſt ſtrongly: For at his firſt entring into his Miniſtery<note place="margin">Math. 4.</note> the Diuel tempted him fore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though he left him for a time, yet he came to him againe: But eſpecially hee vſed all his ſtrength to torment our Sauiour Chriſt vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the croſſe, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the wrath of God was vpon him: that occaſion he took to vex our Sauiour as much as hee could, which in the 22.

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nicornes,</hi> ſo cruelly did they vſe him. And yet whereas they thought to haue triumphed ouer him, euen in the very Croſſe hee ſpoiled them and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came them, and triumphed ouer them, and led them <hi>captiues.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore wee ſee there is no cauſe we ſhould bee aſhamed of our Sauiour CHRIST, ſeeing hee hath ouercome, and we are conquerous in him, and therefore to boaſt in that, as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith: <hi>Death</hi>

               <p>And this is matter of comfort, that wee are to deale with one, that is maiſtred, &amp; conquered alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,

               <p>Another is, that this is not humility, but an intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable pride and arrogancy. For what an arrogancy is this that a mortall man will take vpon him to talke of that he neuer heard of, of the word of God? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine what a wretched arrogancy is it, for a mortall man to reſiſt and contradict the ordinance of God! for as there is but one God: ſo there is but <hi>one me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour,</hi>

               <p>And who can be better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our Sauiour CHRIST, for he communicateth with God in his God-head, which Saints and Angels doe not.

               <p>To returne to their pride. To make another Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour is nothing but a proud thing. For is it not a
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:17926:80"/> great pride to doe contrary to the commandement of God? <hi>Iohn. 13.

               <p>Whatſoeuer doth ouerthrow the foundation doth ouerthrow ſaluation: As in Popery, Idolatry, and worſhiping &amp;c. making another head of the Church.</p>
               <p>And vnles it be of the God-head, all their doctrine is not onely errours, but a cleane apoſtacy: for they corrupt all other points. Indeed there be errours, if they held onely, and none els, as free will &amp;c. They might be ſaued, but if they come to this, as to hold worſhiping Angels &amp;c. ouerthrowing the foundation, they exclude themſelues, CHRIST he is <hi>the onely head</hi> of the Church, which conueyeth life to all his parts, and to appoint worſhip to any other is to take him away.</p>
               <p>This ouerthroweth the Papiſts that will haue the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:17926:80"/> Pope to be the miniſteriall head which is a fooliſh thing. For as the head is the higheſt, ſo is our Sauiour CHRIST alone, therefore not the Pope.</p>
               <p>Againe, the head giueth life and motion to all the body, which our Sauiour onely doth, the Pope cannot.</p>
               <p>Againe, in that they ſay the Pope is a miniſteriall head, but our Sauiour CHRIST needeth none<note place="margin">Math. 28.</note> being preſent by his ſpyrit to the end of the world, giuing direction to his Church.</p>
               <p>And the Apoſtle ſhewing that our Sauiour is the head of the Church deſcribeth it, to be tyed as the members of the body to the head, ſo the Church to CHRIST.</p>
               <p>Againe, our Sauiour is the head of the Church to conuay life and ſuſtenance to all the members. And he giueth nouriſhment not to all alike, but to ſome more, ſome leſſe, as they need: for the greater mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers<note place="margin">Note.</note> haue more need of ſuccours, and relief.</p>

               <p>

               <p>The ſumme is to ſet forth vnto vs a confutation of certaine ceremonies intended to be brought in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> by certaine falſe Teachers.

               <p>Which though they be not perticulerly named, yet they may be conceiued well ynough, as touching of ſome bodily things, and taſting of meates.</p>
               <p>Here we obſerue that howſoeuer men be dainty<note place="margin">Note.</note>
                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:17926:82"/> of their <hi>commodities,</hi> and of their liberties, and will go to the Prince before they will goe one whit from them. But come there a falſe teacher into the pulpit to perſwade them from their Chriſtian liberty of meat and drinke they are eaſely perſwaded vnto it, though to their owne damage and trouble.</p>
               <p>As the Iewes would eaſely to make a calfe be brought to forgo their earings. So that howſoeuer theſe things are deare vnto them, yet in matter of religion (or ſuperſtition rather) they will ſpare no coſt, as we ſee in times of Popery, and therefore the Apoſtle vpbraydeth to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that the falſe Prophets could do what they liſt with them, &amp; tread them vnder their feet; ſo that in ſuperſtition, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the ſeruice of God they will part with any thing, in Gods ſeruice they will not part with a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ot. In the perticuler the Apoſtle vſeth a notable figure bringing in the aduerſaries themſelues ſpeaking, <hi>touch not</hi> &amp;c. to ſhew how much they had gained of them, and how far they were caried in their ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as not to touch, or taſt.</p>
               <p>Where we ſee the Apoſtle meeteth with that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and ſuperſtition in Popery, as if he had ſeene it. For we ſee that none might taſt any fleſh on friday, &amp; therefore mothers, if children had taſted it, would haue wiped their teeth.</p>
               <p>And for touching, we ſee, how that none might touch the holy water, &amp; none might touch the Hoſt, though indeed it was no ſacrament, for there was onely the bread, and therefore they muſt haue their gloues on. Howſoeuer our Sauiour himſelfe would ſuffer himſelfe to be handled and touched, and tooke children in his armes. And this ſuperſtition of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery indeed did begin within an. 100. yeares of the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:17926:83"/> Apoſtle, as the ſtories teſtifie, that in 3. daies nay 6. daies, they came to ſuch an abhominable ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that they would not take meat, and if they tooke any, they would take dry bread, or ſome vnpleaſant meat. Nay further, ſome, to the end they would not take any delight in their meat, they would not eate but <hi>riding.</hi> And howſoeuer in thoſe times the abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence was greater, yet for the latter Popery, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of this abſtinence continued, euen amongſt thoſe gluttons, and <hi>tun-bellied</hi> Monks and Fryers, which liued in their ſurfetting and gluttony.</p>
               <p>And indeed vntill a long time there was no Law of faſting, but euery one did as he thought good, but after came in the puniſhment of the Papiſts, that they that eat fleſh ſhould be counted Lowlers. For the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of this, the Apoſtle ſaith, they are dead with the ceremonies of the Law. For if thoſe, that were once ordeyned by God, and were profitable for the trayning vp of men to the ſeruice of God, were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, then much more ought thoſe, that were inuented by the deuice of man, and were neuer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, but rather hurtfull.</p>
               <p>And if thoſe, that were once holy, were reiected, much more ought theſe, that were the prophane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions of men, ſhould take no place.</p>
               <p>And howſoeuer indeed the ceremonies of the Law were borne withall for a time, and (as one ſaith) as an <hi>auncient matrone grauely and honorably brought vnto her graue,</hi> and therefore the Apoſtle did beare with them: yet they would neuer ſuffer the ceremonies of the Gentils to be kept: and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected them, as being vnworthy of any thing, but to be caſt into a hole. And ſuch were the ceremonies of the Papiſts, many of them being borrowed from
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:17926:83"/> the Gentils, as <hi>the holy waters. &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore this place is a ſufficient hammer to batter in peeces all mens ordinances: for ſeing Gods ordinances haue giuen place, much more they.</p>
               <p>A ſecond reaſon againſt theſe ceremonies, is for that thoſe things, which they put holineſſe in, did <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh with the vſe of them.</hi> For the meats going into the<note place="margin">Math. 15. 17.</note> ſtomacke, and after into the <hi>draught,</hi> as our Sauiour ſpeaketh, the ceremonies about them therefore could doe a mans ſoule no good, for they could not come to any further then the belly, if they come ſo far, as the holy water doth not. And therefore the Apoſtle<note place="margin">Rom. 14 17.</note> ſaith, <hi>the kingdome of God ſtandeth not in meats and drinks.</hi> And in the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> they are of no profit, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially being the ordinances of men.</p>

                  </label> After the Apoſtle meeteth with an obiection, which might be made of theſe ceremonies. 1. Wee do theſe things, which indeed are the doctrines of men, but can wee do too much vnto God? For when wee do any thing of our owne will, we ſhall declare our dutifulneſſe vnto God: For if a ſeruant be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:17926:84"/> to Treſh a quarter a day, and he do a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and halfe, ſhall hee be condemned? So doe wee.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> This hath but a ſhew of reaſon and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,<note place="margin">Solution.</note> whereas there is none: For why doth the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant more then hee is appointed? It is becauſe his Maiſter knoweth not how much he is able to do. But God is infinitely wiſe, and appointeth euery man his taske as hee is able, and none ought to go beyond, and therefore howſoeuer wee may exceede mens commandements, and pleaſe them, and do well, yet it is not ſo with God.</p>
               <p>Heere then wee ſee the abhominableneſſe of the workes of <hi>ſuper-errogation,</hi> that a man can go beyond the performance of the commandements of God, whereas none is able to performe the leaſt aright, this is a deteſtable thing.</p>

                  </label> 
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> But euery humility is not commendable, for. 2. <hi>Kings. 16. 7. Achaz</hi> as wretched a King as euer was, when as the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the. 10. Tribes came againſt him, ſendeth to <hi>Tyglath Pelazer,</hi> ſaying to him: <hi>Thy ſonne and ſeruant,</hi> whereas hee was a King as good as the other, and in regard of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of God, ſhould haue gone before all other: In <hi>Eſay.</hi> 57. 9. it was ſaid to the Iewes, <hi>Thou didſt humble thy ſelfe vnto the grane:</hi> Whereas they ſhould haue humbled themſelues to God alone: So in <hi>Eſay.</hi> 2. 8. 9. it is ſaid: The people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> humbled themſelues and croucht to the Idols, which is an <hi>abhominable hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility</hi> and <hi>baſeneſſe,</hi> and a <hi>pride</hi> in that they riſe vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Gods commandement.</p>
               <p>3 <hi>Obiect.</hi> This is to tame the body, by faſting.</p>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:17926:84"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Faſting in deed is a good thing if well vſed, but ſo to faſt as to diſhonour the body, and to diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it to glorifie God withall, is to bee condemned. For the body is honoured, when it is kept to bee ſtrong and able, cheerefully and thankfully to walke in the ſeruice of God.</p>
               <p>Thus the wretched abuſe of the Papiſts in their faſtings, and <hi>Ieſuites</hi> in whipping themſelues, was a deteſtable thing vnto God, as in the Prieſts of <hi>Ball.</hi> But that humiliation which is by a diligent and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full walking and labouring in our calling, to the end that by idleneſſe the body be not puffed vp, is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable humbling &amp; keeping downe of the body, but that of the Papiſts was moſt abhominable, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they made their whippings and ſtripes, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the paſſion of our Sauiour Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Againe, the Apoſtle ſaith, howſoeuer they ſeeme, yet, ſaith hee, theſe are <hi>nothing worth:</hi> For howſoeuer in times of affliction of the Church, and vpon ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all occaſions, &amp;c. there be greater need of humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But of theſe ordinary humiliations, when as the body is too much kept vnder, is contrary to that which the Lord requireth: And therfore it is that the Apoſtle blameth <hi>Tymothy</hi> for this, who though hee<note place="margin">1. Tim. 5. 23.</note> were an excellent yong man, yet had this infirmity that hee kept his body too much vnder, for which cauſe he would drinke nothing but water.</p>
               <p>4 And the laſt reaſon is, that theſe were, for the <hi>fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the fleſh, viz:</hi> they were but belly-matters ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertayning to the fleſh, and therefore periſhable with the fleſh, which hath bene ſpoken of before; or for the pleaſing of mans fleſhly mind: Therefore to be auoided.</p>

               <p>There are ſome things to be learned of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring that before with this: 1. After the Apoſtle had laid downe the grounds of true doctrine, and ouerthrowne the falſe, he now teacheth wholeſome duties of good life.</p>
               <p>Whence we learne that except wee be grafted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to CHRIST, wee cannot poſſibly bring forth any good workes; And therefore the Apoſtle layeth down firſt the doctrine of Iuſtification by CHRIST alone: And therefore if men haue not faith, the beſt workes are ſinne, not to ſpeake of Nunneries, which are the neſts of vermine.</p>
               <p>Further this is to ouerthrow the Papiſts, that thinke by the naturall power, they bring into the world, before any grace is giuen them of God, they can do good works, and after they merit and deſerue it: whereas it is euidently taught heere, they are all ſinne before they be grafted into CHRIST.</p>
               <p>A ſecond thing is, that the Apoſtle, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the doctrine of Chriſtianity, buildeth good works: And therfore in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> he telleth that nothing can
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:17926:86"/> bee done without faith, then after hee exhorteth to<note place="margin">Rom. 14. 23.</note> good workes. So to the <hi>Galathians,</hi> hauing Preached faith in CHRIST, hee perſwadeth them to doe good workes. In vaine wee make profeſſion of good workes, and bring forth nothing in our life and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation. <hi>Iam. 2. 26. Faith without workes is dead.</hi> If a man knew all the things in heauen and the earth, and he were mounted vp as high as the Angels, yet if his life bee not anſwerable, hee had bene better neuer to haue made profeſſion.</p>
               <p>When the Apoſtle hath ſpoken againſt Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, new Moones, and Holy daies, ſaue the Sabaoth, of touching and handling, a man will ſay, what will you haue vs doe nothing, of this, then let vs ſet <hi>the cooke on the cooke,</hi> let vs eate, and drinke, and make good-cheere, and take our pleaſure: The Apoſtle an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth, that the Lord hath not taken away the yoke to follow our owne luſts, but to glorifie God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. And therefore it hath beene found that they haue taken more paines to go to hell then others haue done, becauſe wee will not faſt, and pull downe our bodies: but they condemne Papiſts almes, becauſe they giue none themſelues.</p>
               <p>1. Point, an exhortation to quickning and new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If yee haue bene rayſed, &amp;c.</hi> where the Apoſtle lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs to our tryall, and giueth vs a notable tryall, whether we are of CHRIST, for then we are raiſed vp to heauen, but if wee bee <hi>grouelings,</hi> heere in the things of this life, then wee are not riſen againe, but are on earth: for all theſe go together: for hee that is grafted in CHRIST, hee is quickened, and hee riſeth with CHRIST: for hee roſe not on earth, but into heauen.</p>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:17926:86"/>
               <p>Now let vs examine whether wee are riſen with CHRIST, which is if wee aſcend, which may bee knowne if we ſeeke the things aboue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seeke,</hi> that is to haue a care: for that a man ſeeketh, he deſireth to come vnto, and takes care for, and ſo the Apoſtle ſaith: <hi>a man muſt ſtudy and muſe with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</hi> So <hi>Salomon</hi> willeth wee ſhould dig, and labour for wiſedome, otherwiſe it is no ſigne that we are ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen with CHRIST.</p>
               <p>Now let vs conſider if wee bee in the number of thoſe, that ſeeke after heauen. There are found ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that ſeeke for things of this life, and change coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries to make themſelues rich: But how many haue come to ſeeke the word? nay when they haue it brought to their dore they do contemne it, theſe are far from being raiſed with CHRIST.</p>

For as CHRIST after death roſe againe, ſo if ſinne be dead in you, then you will riſe to the taſte of the things in heauen, and the reaſon why we loue this world ſo, is becauſe we haue no hope of a better, and therefore are laoth to leaue this. And here alſo becauſe it may be ſaid, the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> are ſubiect to troubles, beſides the ſinnes that they cary about with them.</p>
               <p>To this he anſwers, it is true it is hidden, that the<note place="margin">Solution.</note> world ſeeth not this ſaluation, and hidden from you, that is, that you haue not ſuch a feeling of it, as you ſhall haue. And yet as a thing hidden, that it ſhall be ſeene.</p>
               <p>Hope is of things, that are not preſent, then ſeing our ſaluation is by hope, therefore we ſhall receiue<note place="margin">Cant. 1. 4.</note> it.

               </p>
               <p>So that we ſee here that the Church is not ſo beutified and glorified here, as it it to be eſteemed.</p>
               <p>2. Reaſon, is, becauſe he is the keeper, it is ſafe, no man can take it away, and therefore Cant. 26. The Church is compared to a ſteepe rocke, where no<note place="margin">1.

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:17926:88"/> power of hell is not able to preuaile: and therefore it is ſaid, it is hid with God.</p>
               <p>3 Reaſon. It is hidden in CHRIST, who appeares<note place="margin">Verſ. 4. 3.</note> not as he is, nay not as he ſhall be: for he is appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to haue all his ſubiects.

               <p>This is more notably ſet forth in the reuelation<note place="margin">Reuelation. 21. 10. 21.</note> where it is ſaid; That it is a City on a hill full of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſtones, impoſſible to be found in the world, the gates of precious ſtone, the ſtreets pure gold. Theſe are meanes to point at, not able to expreſſe
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:17926:89"/> the glory of it. If we will heare of this further, it is ſaid that when CHRIST was tranſlated, <hi>Peter</hi> tooke ſuch delight in ſeing <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that though he were in his naturall bodie yet he tooke ſuch delight, that he ſaid: <hi>It is good for vs to be</hi>

               <p>And then ſure if they had ſuch delight, when they were in their naturall corrupt bodies, then much more when they ſhall be changed: then the ioy ſhall be ſuch, as no ey hath ſeene, nor eare hath heard &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And then it will follow that they will leaue thoſe filthineſſes that they haue here with them, as it is ſaid in the next verſe. It followes;</p>

               <p>The exhortation is, <hi>mortifie your earthly members,</hi> or members vpon the earth &amp;c. One reaſon is drawne from the puniſhment: becauſe the wrath of God is againſt ſuch perſons, as offend in theſe, or any of them.</p>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:17926:91"/>
               <p>Another reaſon, becauſe they had bene ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and therefore muſt not be ſo <hi>hereafter.</hi> In the exhortation we haue heard that a man is a whole lumpe and body of ſinne, whereof euery ſinne is a member. Againe, becauſe ſinne is ſo nerely ioyned and hardly tyed to vs that they can hardly be draw from vs.</p>
               <p>They are called <hi>earthly,</hi> becauſe they drawe vs from heauen and heauenly things. Which is ment not onely of the body, but alſo of the ſoule, not in regard of the ſubſtance of it, for that is a ſpirit, but in regard it tendeth vnto ſuch things.</p>
               <p>Now we are to come to the perticularities. The Apoſtle ſpeaketh againſt certaine ſinnes againſt the ſeuenth commandement, of adultery. Which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle nameth, <hi>viz.</hi> not thoſe, which all men hold to be ſinnes, &amp; confeſſed to be ſo, as whoredome. &amp;c. But he ſetteth againſt thoſe ſinnes which the world doth ſmally account of.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Fornication,</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Vncleanneſſe.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. <hi>Wantonneſſe.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>4. <hi>Concupiſcence.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>For the firſt, <hi>fornication.</hi> The Apoſtle ſpeaketh againſt it: for amongſt the gentils it was accounted to be no ſinne, or rather a ſmall ſinne, douting of it. And therefore acts. 15. In the generall councell the Apoſtles concluded that it ſhould be abſtayned from, as a moſt ſhamefull and horrible ſinne. So that paſſing by the groſſer ſinnes he beginneth with this.</p>
               <p>This the Apoſtle proueth to be a ſhamefull and<note place="margin">1. Cor. 6. 19. 20.</note> vile ſinne. For hereby God is put out (1. Cor. 6.) of his poſſeſſion, for ſeing our body ſhould be
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:17926:91"/> conſecrated vnto God, what a ſhame and horrible thing is it, when men ſhould make it a ſtewes to the Diuell?</p>
               <p>Againe, an other reaſon: In that he that commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth fornication maketh his body the <hi>member of an</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 6. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>harlot,</hi> which ſhould be the member of CHRIST, ſo that as much as in him lyeth, hee maketh CHRIST alſo a member of that body.</p>
               <p>Againe, an other reaſon: This ſinne is againſt the body, for other ſinnes are without the body, and the occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as is the ſin of drunkennes: But this is againſt<note place="margin">1. Cor. 6. 18.</note> the body it ſelfe, making it filthy and vncleane, and ſubiect vnto diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>This ſinne the Apoſtle ſtandeth ſo much vpon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that they eſteemed ſo light of it: And is not the ſame thing now that men lightly eſteeme of it and count it a <hi>Tricke of youth, &amp;c.</hi> and if the worſt come they can marry the party with whom they haue fornicated, but the Lord doth not ſo eſteeme of it.</p>
               <p>2 <hi>Vncleaneſſe</hi>) Meant all manner of vncleane words and deeds, which do not reach vnto the act of forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, as all manner of vncleane kiſſings, and ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches tending to vncleaneſſe, though they come not to the height of fornication; and therefore wee ſee how lightly men eſteeme of theſe alſo, yet they are horrible and vile in the ſight of God. And howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer men ſay, they thinke no hurt, yet as where we ſee ſmoake, we ſay is fire: ſo where theſe are, there is a fire of concupiſcence.</p>
               <p>3 <hi>Wantonneſſe:</hi>) The word ſignifieth paſſions: but as in other places where the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of this ſinne, ſo here it is taken for wantonneſſe, whereby is meant all lightneſſe of the eyes, apparell, gates or
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:17926:92"/> other behauiours, tending alſo to fornication and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleaneſſe.</p>
               <p>Laſtly <hi>concupiſence,</hi> which is the leaſt ſinne againſt the 7. Commandement, which is the deſire of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleaneneſſe with conſent, <hi>Mat:</hi> 5. 28. for deſire with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſent, belongs to the laſt Commandement, which our Sauiour CHRIST noteth.</p>
               <p>Another ſinne, which the Apoſtle ſpeaketh againſt is <hi>couetouſneſſe,</hi> comming neere to that vncleaneſſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, by couetouſneſſe is not onely meant when any do wreſt and wring whatſoeuer they can lay hold on. As the Prophet (<hi>Ieremy</hi> 8.) ſaith, <hi>They get their goods falſely:</hi> But there is beſides an other thing, when they haue an earneſt deſire of the muck of the world, which cannot bee ſatisfied, as the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> ſaith, <hi>They deſire to ioyne houſe to houſe, &amp;c.</hi> ſignifying<note place="margin">Eſay 5. 8.</note> an exceſſiue deſire of riches, which cannot bee ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied.</p>
               <p>But further, another coueteouſneſſe, which here is to bee abhorred, when a man reioyſeth in his riches, and takes them to be his <hi>credit</hi> or <hi>honour,</hi> as in <hi>Iob</hi> 31. where hee purgeth himſelfe, as of truſting in his ric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, ſo alſo of his reioyſing in his riches, though he was the richeſt man in all that country.</p>
               <p>Thus hee that is not content with his eſtate, but thruſting himſelfe into diuers Trades and Occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to enlarge himſelfe, is a couetous perſon. And this is a notable ſinne, and ſo much the more feareful in that it is not called in queſtion by men, by the Church, nor puniſhed.</p>
               <p>This the Scripture ſpeaketh againſt, as that it is a vaine and vnprofitable thing, for whatſoeuer they ſcratch they ſhall carry nothing out.</p>
               <p>Againe, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 9. It caſteth a man into diuers
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:17926:92"/> euils and noyſome luſts, for it maketh him to haue a ſhipwracke of conſcience, and ſo is that which depriues him of all good arguments of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
               <p>But of all places none more notable againſt this<note place="margin">Note.</note> ſinne then this place heere, that it is <hi>idolatry.</hi> Now idolatry is ſtrictly and largely taken.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Strictly,</hi> when a man doth fall downe and worſhip idols and images in ſteed of God.</p>
               <p>It is alſo taken more <hi>largely:</hi> for that when a mans heart is drawne and ſtolne from God, and is ſet vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any thing whatſoeuer, as vpon meate and drinke: the glutton maketh it his God, &amp;c. ſo of vncleaneſſe, &amp;c. But yet more notably couetouſneſſe is called<note place="margin">Note.</note> 
                  <hi>idolatry,</hi> becauſe firſt it maketh him that is couetous to be <hi>proud,</hi> and lift himſelfe aboue others. Againe, it makes him to truſt in his riches, which adultery, and fornication, &amp; other ſins do not worke in a man. For none is proud and confident in their filthineſſe, &amp;c. And therefore it is that the Apoſtle both to the <hi>Epheſians</hi> and heere, calleth this idolatry. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin">Ephe. 5.</note> idolatry is not onely among the Papiſts, but euen to bee found amongſt vs that haue renounced Popery. And would they could not charge vs of this idolatry, when they ſay there is ſo little almes to the poore, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And the Apoſtle nameth this idolatry to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſians,</hi> from whom Idolatry was abandoned, and therefore noteth that it is a ſhame for them hauing abandoned idolatry to maintaine this. Thus much of the exhortation from ſinne.</p>
               <p>The reaſons follow: The firſt is drawne from the puniſhment of God, that the wrath of God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of diſobedience in theſe things.</p>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:17926:93"/>
               <p>This is a great and fearefull thing to haue the wrath of God againſt a man. The louing counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God is a great and excellent thing: And therefore <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, thy louing countenance I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire<note place="margin">Pſalme 4</note> aboue <hi>gold, corne</hi> or <hi>oile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31. In the louing countenance of God is life and ioy: ſo on the contrary, in his wrath is death and ſorrow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Saloman</hi> ſaith that the anger of a Prince is like<note place="margin">Prou. 16. 12.</note> the <hi>roaring of a Lyon</hi> after his prey: what is then the anger of the eternall God?</p>
               <p>By the wrath of God is noted the effect of the wrath of God, that puniſhment, death, condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is the reward of the wickedneſſe, ſpoken of before, proceeding from the anger of God, as the cauſe.</p>
               <p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiection. </seg>
                  </label> Why doth hee ſay the wrath and not the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
               <p>I anſwere, to the end that wee ſhould as louing<note place="margin">Solution.</note> children, more feare and bee grieued at the wrath of God, then at the puniſhment.</p>
               <p>Another reaſon becauſe where the wrath is, there will come puniſhment: if God be angry hee will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely puniſh.</p>
               <p>And howſoeuer men do not regard this, becauſe the Magiſtrate doth not puniſh, yet if he neglect, yet the Lords ſword is ready drawne, and fearefully will reuenge. And it is a feareful thing to fal into the hand of the liuing God. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 31.</p>
               <p>In that he ſaith (<hi>is vpon</hi>) in the <hi>Preſent Tenſe,</hi> it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth<note place="margin">Verſe 6.</note> a continuance of the puniſhment of God, ſo that euen the very ſin it ſelfe is a puniſhment of God. And therefore <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. when men would not hearken to the word, the wrath of God from heauen is powred
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:17926:93"/> vpon the ſonnes of diſobedience, by all that rabble of ſinnes there recited in the moſt of that Chapter, which are iudgements of God.</p>
               <p>So that howſoeuer men feeling no ſmart vpon their bodies, yet if they could feele indeed the wrath of God in theſe, they ſhould ſee how feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full a puniſhment it is to be giuen ouer to drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, fornication, and the like. We ſee the effects of Gods wrath on this ſinne. In <hi>Numbers</hi> we reade of twenty and foure thouſand ſlaine for this ſinne: And for the defiling of <hi>Dinah</hi> a whole Citty was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.<note place="margin">Gen 34. 27.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore ſeeing ſinnes vnpuniſhed vpon the whole land, therefore it behoueth the Magiſtrate to looke narrowly ſo farre as the law will reach, to puniſh this ſinne ſharply. The not puniſhing of the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſhing<note place="margin">Iudg. 19. &amp; 20. 46. 48.</note> of the <hi>Leuits</hi> wife, coſt the <hi>Beniamites</hi> much bloud and loſſe.</p>
               <p>And howſoeuer we renounce the errour of the <hi>Maniches,</hi> yet wee in practiſe affirme their aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that God was a fierce and ſharpe God vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, but a mercifull God vnder the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell: But God is <hi>the ſame,</hi> and will the rather puniſh<note place="margin">Pſal. 102. 27.</note> this ſinne, becauſe wee haue receiued more graces then they vnder the law, and perforce we are to look for greater and heauier iudgements if wee doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke him.</p>
               <p>And this belongs to ruſſians, &amp; to them which ſay, ſo that I be ſpared <hi>vnto the end,</hi> I care not, God is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull. yet let them know, that if they deferre their<note place="margin">Note.</note> repentance till the end, and liue in their pleaſure, yet though they liue the life of <hi>Methuſhelah</hi> in their pleaſures, one moment in hell ſhal exceed in torment all thoſe pleaſures.</p>
               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:17926:94"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vpon the children of diſobedience.</hi>) Where we ſee that<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erſe. 6.</note> the Lords iudgments are executed vpon the vnfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and wicked; which the Lord doth (as the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domonians</hi>)<note place="margin">Note.</note> who to make their ſonnes hate drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, would make the ſeruants (which they loued worſt) drunken. So doth God after a ſort, who to make his children hate their ſinnes, doth puniſh the wicked, but his children are not puniſhed; and yet they ſcape not free: for we ſee <hi>Dauid</hi> for his adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry<note place="margin">2. Sam. 13. &amp; 15. &amp; 16. 22.</note> and murder what iudgements followed, his owne Concubines were defiled by his ſonnes, hee was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt driuen from his kingdome, and one ſonne ſlue another; yea after his death bloud ceaſed not from his poſterity, as in the beginning of <hi>Salomons</hi> reigne; yet this is not a puniſhment: for a puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is death, which onely is to the wicked, but to Gods children a <hi>Correction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another reaſon which the Apoſtle rendreth, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe<note place="margin">Verſe 7.</note> ſuch they had been <hi>in times paſt:</hi> and yet were receiued to fauour and mercy by the Lord. And therefore it behoued them to beware of their former ſinnes, to walke like new men, being receiued into a new ſtate.</p>
               <p>For what a mercy of God is this to receiue vs, when we haue euen ſpent our ſelues in ſinne? What maiſter, when a man hath ſpent himſelfe and his<note place="margin">Note.</note> ſtrength in another mans ſeruice, will take this man to himſelfe, and make him his ſeruant? But the Lord doth ſo, hee taketh vs, though we haue beene groſſe ſinners, and hee doth account vs as if wee had not ſinned: As in <hi>Ezechiel</hi> he ſaith: <hi>If the righteous</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezek. 18. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>man forſake his righteous wayes, I will forget his righteous deeds.</hi> Contrary: <hi>If a wicked man repent, and do the thing that is good, he ſhall not dye, but liue.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Againe, wee are <hi>wounded</hi> by ſinne, and therefore<note place="margin">Note.</note> we ought to returne to be healed: for what woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded man would not deſire to bee healed? and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are to returne betimes to the Lord, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake our euill wayes, how long ſoeuer we haue liued in them before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Walked.</hi>) Here the Apoſtle maketh a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the wicked man, that goeth forward in ſinne, and the children of God, that fall by infirmity: as DAVID, that hauing falled, yet continued not in it.</p>

               <p>And therefore let vs examine our ſelues whether ſinne haue that force, that it makes vs come at a call; let us ſearch if wee liue in it: for if we doe, then ſhall we walke and run after it, and performe the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of it; Therefore hee ſaith: <hi>Wherein ye walked, when ye liued in them.</hi>

               <p>Sometimes for the word vſed for malice, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times taken for all manner of euill and ſinne, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times<note place="margin">Math. 6. 34.</note> for cares, as in <hi>Mathew: the malice of the day is ſufficient for the day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here it ſignifieth with anger, a deſire to be aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and a ſeeking alſo to be aduenged. This is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to the mildnes, which is ſpoken of before, &amp; foloweth, which is a willingneſſe in men to do good.</p>
               <p>This is a thing cleane contrary to the nature of God, and therefore ought to be cleane contrary to the nature of man, for as the Apoſtle ſaith, none will hurt <hi>his owne body.</hi> Now we are the fleſh one of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other:<note place="margin">Eph. 5. 29.</note> and therefore the Heathen men ſay, that euery one <hi>is a God, or deuill,</hi> one to another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Euill ſpeaking:</hi> This is a grieuous ſinne, as that which taketh away the good name of a man, for we know a good name bringeth comfort vnto a man: therefore it is compared to the <hi>ſweet oyntment,</hi> that<note place="margin">Ec. 7. 3.</note> comforteth a man, and therefore he that taketh away a mans good name, is as it were his hangman, and murtherer, in the time of his trouble, when this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort ſhould moſt ſtand him in ſtead.</p>
               <p>Againe, beſides that the name of men, the name of God alſo is blaſphemed, for euery child of God carieth the name of his father in the forehead of his profeſſion. And therefore Rom. 2. the Apoſtle ſaith that the <hi>Iewes</hi> cauſed the name of God to be blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed.</p>
               <p>Another fruite of malice is <hi>reuiling,</hi> as we ſee when
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:17926:98"/> men are maliciouſly bent towards any, we ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is ſo vile and filthy, but we will giue it in their teeth; And though this be expounded of adultery and vncleanneſſe, yet becauſe that hath bene ſpoken of before, and this is the common place of anger, it ſeemeth rather to be referred to it, though the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be an abhominable ſinne.</p>
               <p>Againe, malice hath another foule and ſhamefull effect, <hi>viz.</hi> to bring forth lying one of another. For if they can get any ſhamefull report of others, which is true, they will not ſticke, but caſt it forth: but if they can get no truth, they will inuent lyes againſt them to diſgrace them. But the Apoſtle ſaith, that though it be truth, yet we ought not to reuile one another, nor to vſe any ſuch reports, by repeating their ſinnes: for it is the duty of the magiſtrate or miniſter to rebuke, not of a priuate man in his owne quarrell to reuenge himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Another reaſon he vſeth in bidding vs <hi>to put</hi> off theſe old rags of ſinne, where he vſeth a notable metaphor, comparing mortificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to a putting off, of our cloaths and ſinnes, to filthy torne rags. And<note place="margin">Note.</note> therefore as a man will be aſhamed of filthy rags, and therefore will caſt them off before he come in company; So ought we to doe, being come into the Church of God.</p>
               <p>But eſpecially when we are to come into the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, into the ſeruice of God, we are to caſt of theſe tatters of ſinne, for as if we are to goe before a Prince we will not goe in any loathſome apparell, much leſſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming into the preſence of God ſhould<note place="margin">Math. 22.</note> we come in our ſinnes.</p>
               <p>And therefore our Sauiour CHRIST, when the man came not in a wedding garment, but was in a
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:17926:98"/> beggars garments, bids caſt him out.</p>

                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> It is true, we are all beggars, and worſe.<note place="margin">Solution.</note> nay <hi>worſe</hi> then the vileſt <hi>rogues</hi> and <hi>vagabounds,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we come to him: But being admitted into his houſe, he offers vs royall garments, which if we put not on, caſting away our old <hi>rags,</hi> our iudgement is the greater.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The old man</hi> 1. the originall corruption, which<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erſe. 9.</note> is the root of all ſinne, and therefore is called<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 14. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>ſinne</hi> it ſelfe, and a <hi>law</hi> of the <hi>members,</hi> for that it giueth direction to all the members, as a law, to doe that which is naught, as it giueth direction to the<note place="margin">Note.</note> hand, foot, eyes, and toung, to ſinne. Therefore in <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 25. the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>I ſerue in my fleſh the law of ſinne.</hi> And it doth not onely giue <hi>direction,</hi> but as a <hi>law,</hi> it <hi>ruleth</hi> vs: for we can no ſooner haue a wicked motion, put into vs, to be moued to a wicked thing, but preſently it ſetteth vs in hand, and ſetteth vs about it, till we be regenerated.</p>
               <p>The ſecond part of the exhortation to quickning: <hi>put on the new man:</hi> where regeneration and newneſſe of life is compared to a <hi>new garment,</hi> which is to be laboured to be put on of vs, becauſe it pleaſeth God, and his holy Angels, and Saints.</p>
               <p>And if we deſire ornaments to decke our ſelues before men, much more to decke our ſelues with thoſe ornaments, which may be acceptable before God. And therefore theſe are ſaid in the Prouerbs to be ornaments, abiliments, precious, chaines, bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celets &amp;c.</p>
               <p>That it is called the <hi>new man,</hi> as that which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a man a new, though he be but yong: &amp; though
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:17926:99"/> he be an old man, yet by this meanes an old man is made a new man, if he haue piety and godlineſſe in him, it maketh him to floriſh and <hi>bud</hi> againe; though his hand faile him, yet if he haue the hand of faith, if his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oot faile him, yet if he haue the foot of holineſſe and righteouſneſſe to walke to heauen, he is in an excellent eſtate. Whereas contrariwiſe, he that is yong, and is not regenerate, is an old man: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he that is both vn-regenerate and old in body, he is in a pittifull caſe.</p>
               <p>What is it to be a new man? to be renewed in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe. Hereby is ſet forth what we are by <hi>creation,</hi> what by <hi>nature,</hi> what by <hi>grace</hi> and regeneration. For the firſt, when we were crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, we were made holy, like vnto God, not of the nature of God, but like in holineſſe and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>But what are we now? void of knowledge of God and of righteouſneſſe. For what we know, we onely know ſo much, as ſhould make vs inexcuſable: no ſauing knowledge, much leſſe are we able to walke righteouſly before God.</p>
               <p>The excellent eſtate, that we are reſtored vnto, is here ſet forth, and in the <hi>Epheſians</hi> more plainly,<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 24.</note> to be renued firſt in the <hi>knowledge</hi> of God, ſecondly in the walking <hi>holily</hi> before God, and thirdly in wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <hi>iuſtly</hi> and vprightly before God.</p>
               <p>So that now we are to ſee the excellency of our regeneration. For howſoeuer the creation of man was a more excellent worke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to make the world, and therefore the <hi>three perſons</hi> are brought in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting<note place="margin">Gen. 1. 26.</note> together ſhewing an excellent worke.

               <p>Of the firſt we haue heard, and entred into the ſecond: we haue heard a generall exhortation to quickning, which we haue heard to be deſcribed, by the <hi>new man,</hi> and is more perticulerly expounded, and ſet forth in this text. As if he ſhould ſay.</p>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:17926:100"/>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> Which vertues muſt be declared effectually, not onely in forbearing one another, but alſo in frankly forgiuing one another, if any haue a quarrell one againſt another, euen as CHRIST hath frankly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen you, euen ſo do yee.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> And though thoſe bee ſingular vertues, yet aboue them all, as the roote and mother of them, decke your ſelues with loue, which is as it were a bond to bind in a bundle, thoſe, and all other vertues, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to perfection, and without which there is no ſoundneſſe in any of them, what glittering ſhew ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer they carry.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> And though the ſpirit of the old man within you, hath a deſire to contend, yet let the peace of God beare the ſway and ouer-come: vnto the which peace you are euidently called, in that you are members of one myſticall body. For the better entertainment of which peace, bee gratefull one to another, as well in conferring, as in requiting benefits.</p>
               <p>The ſumme is a declaration and ſetting forth par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of the new man, which wee are exhorted to put on.</p>
               <p>Firſt, he ſets forth the particular vertues: then the mother of them.</p>
               <p>Hee had before exhorted them to put on the new man, renewed in knowledge, and holineſſe:</p>
               <p>Now a man might aske <hi>what this new man is?</hi> and therefore hee ſetteth forth what it is by euery quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:17926:101"/> of it: what cloth and cote wee muſt put on.</p>
               <p>Heere the Apoſtle noteth that naturally we are all<note place="margin">Note.</note> 
                  <hi>naked,</hi> and ſhamefull in the ſight of God: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as modeſt perſons will bee aſhamed to looke on their owne nakedneſſe, ſo we naturally are naked and deteſtable in the ſight of the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore we muſt bee aſhamed of our nakedneſſe, and labour to get on thoſe garments, whereby wee may bee holy and couered in the ſight of God, which elſe are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominable in his ſight.</p>
               <p>This was it that the Lord exhorteth the Church of <hi>Laodicea, That ſhee thought her ſelfe rich, &amp;c.</hi> but thou art naked and poore: and therefore come and <hi>buy white cloathing of mee</hi> to couer thy filthineſſe and<note place="margin">Reu. 3. 17. 18.</note> ſhame, which prouoketh mee: But how ſhall we buy, ſeeing wee haue nothing to giue the Lord? The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet anſwereth, buy <hi>for nothing.</hi> And therefore ſeeing<note place="margin">Iſay 58. 1. 2.</note> for coſtly apparell, comely onely in the ſight of men, we will both giue exceeding much, &amp; go for it, what a ſhame is it for vs that we wil not go for this apparel, which maketh vs coſtly in the ſight of God?</p>
               <p>And theſe are not onely comely, but precious gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and coſtly: In <hi>Prouerbes</hi> 4. and in diuers places they be called <hi>Iewels,</hi> and <hi>Pearles,</hi> and pretious <hi>orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> and <hi>bracelets, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Heere firſt hee ſetteth the cauſes, then the vertues. The cauſes, 1. becauſe we are <hi>choſen</hi> and <hi>elect:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to doe good works, to walke holily, and put on the cloth of righteouſneſſe, as the Apoſtle ſaith to the <hi>Epheſians: He hath choſen vs, that we ſhould bee holy</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ephe. 1. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>and blameleſſe:</hi> Where wee ſee what a falſe charge the Papiſts giue vpon the holy doctrine of Election, that it is a doctrine of looſeneſſe, whereas the Apoſtle teacheth vs it is a doctrine to moue to holines of life.</p>
               <pb n="193" facs="tcp:17926:101"/>
               <p>Another reaſon, <hi>Becauſe yee are holy.</hi> Here hee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a ſimilitude from the veſſels of the Temple, ſet a-part for the ſeruice of God in the Temple: And therefore we ſee the fearefull iudgement of God vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Bal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aſar,</hi> for prophaning the veſſels of God in his<note place="margin">Dan. 5. 3. 30.</note> banquet. Euen ſo, we being ſeperate, and ſet a-part by holineſſe of life, to the ſeruice of God, it is a ſhame for vs to giue our ſelues to ſerue men, or our owne luſts and affections.</p>
               <p>A third reaſon is in the word <hi>Beloued:</hi> yee are lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of God, therefore loue the things that he loues.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>
                  </label> 
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> How ſhall I know that I am the beloued child of God?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> If I finde in me the fruits of the grace of<note place="margin">Solution.</note> God; I muſt examine my ſelfe therefore, whether I haue faith, whether I haue the loue of God in me, or no; whether I haue any righteouſneſſe in me, or no. And therefore the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſheweth, that wee<note place="margin">2. Pet. 1. 10.</note> may make our election and calling ſure by good works; And therfore the cauſe that men ſtumble, and breake their neckes in matter of election is, that they will go to the <hi>Vniuerſity of Election,</hi> before they haue been at the <hi>Grammar-ſchoole of Calling,</hi> and <hi>Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> And therefore they argue: Hee that is elected ſhall be ſaued, liue he as he liſt. Which yet is falſe: for<note place="margin">Note.</note> the elected ſhall liue holily: And ſo contrary, If I be a reprobate, I ſhall be damned, liue I neuer ſo holily and godlily. But this alſo is falſe: for as he that is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected to ſaluation, muſt needs bee ſanctified; ſo he that is not, cannot. And therefore wee are not to climbe to the top of Gods Councell to know our election, but muſt begin below by our ſanctification.</p>
               <p>Now we are elected all of vs, onely by the loue and grace of God, we haue nothing of our ſelues, and
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:17926:102"/> therefore none are better then another, nor can helpe our ſelues any whit. And becauſe wee are elected by the free grace of God, it is another reaſon to proue that we ſhould put on holineſſe.</p>
               <p>The vertues follow. <hi>Bowels of Compaſſion, viz.</hi> the tender affection one towards another, 1. <hi>Kings.</hi> 3.<note place="margin">1. King. 3. 26.</note> which was ſhewed when as the childe ſhould be cut in ſunder, the right mother her bowels were moued within her at the danger of the childe, and by no meanes would haue it diuided. This is the compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which we ſhould haue one towards another, euen when we ſee any in danger; much more when they are in trouble, which we ſee to be often in our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our CHRIST.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Eaſineſſe to be vſed:</hi> for ſo the word ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth, whereby a man is ready and eaſie to giue himſelfe to the vſe of other, contrary to the peruerſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and frowardneſſe that is in many. This is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary thing: for as inwardly there ought to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, ſo outwardly there ſhould be cheerefulneſſe of countenance, and readineſſe to be helpfull vnto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. This is as belonging to all, ſo to rich men eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, becauſe they are ready to fall into this rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, being puffed vp with pride, by reaſon of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as wee ſee in the churliſhneſſe of <hi>Nabal</hi> to <hi>Dauid.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Sam. 25. 10.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Modeſty</hi> and <hi>Humility,</hi> whereby we thinke baſely of our ſelues, and highly well of others. The contrary wherof we ſee practiſed amongſt vs, in that men thinke too well of themſelues, and therefore ſet a cheape priſe of other men, contrary to the Apoſtles precept. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiection. </seg>
                  </label> 
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But I ſhal then thinke a lye: for ſhall I thinke that he hath more knowledge then I, being ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t?</p>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:17926:102"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> We are not ſo to thinke, but yet not to thinke<note place="margin">Solution.</note> our ſelues better then we are. And this is eſpecially meant of ſanctification.</p>
               <p>And therefore when we ſee a man liue without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny<note place="margin">Note.</note> outward blot of diſorder, we are to thinke bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of him, then of our ſelues, becauſe <hi>Wee know more euill in our ſelues,</hi> and can accuſe our ſelues of more ſinnes then we can do another man, whom we cannot know ſo well as our ſelues, and which hath peraduenture leſſe knowledge then we.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Meekneſſe,</hi> whereby anger is both preuented and pacified: for whereas hee had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of two kindes of anger, one ſudden, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther continued. This doth take them both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>Long-ſuffering,</hi> when hee will not bee prouoked to anger, but put it off. This bringeth forth: firſt, bearing one with another, and not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to reuenge, as the manner is: And ſecondly, to forgiue, for that is the right and true bearing one with another: for elſe we do not forbeare: for there be many that will forbeare for a time, but will put it off till a further time of reuenge, which is a more horrible ſinne, as wee ſee in wicked <hi>Abſolon,</hi> that did make a ſhew of loue to <hi>Ammon,</hi> and ſayd to<note place="margin">2. Sam. 13. 20. 28.</note> his ſiſter: <hi>Hee is thy brother,</hi> yet after reuenged that iniury done to him in his ſiſter, with his death.</p>
               <p>This forgiueneſſe the Apoſtle proueth by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of our Sauiour Chriſt, who exhorteteth alſo to forgiueneſſe, if our brother offend, not onely ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen<note place="margin">Math. 28. 22.</note> times, but ſeuenty times ſeuen times; and ſeing the Lord hath forgiuen vs infinite talants, we ought much more to forgiue our brother our debt, which
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:17926:103"/> is not an hundred pence in reſpect of the other.</p>
               <p>Hauing ſet downe all theſe, he after commendeth one principall vertue, <hi>viz.</hi> that which is the mother of them all, <hi>viz. Loue,</hi> where we are to ſee the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Papiſts, who make loue the cauſe of all the other vertues, becauſe it is the mother.</p>
               <p>True, wee will grant that <hi>Loue</hi> is the <hi>Mother</hi> of<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Note.</hi> 1. Tim. 1. 5.</note> them, ſo that they grant that <hi>Faith</hi> is the <hi>Grandmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> from which <hi>Loue</hi> it ſelfe proceedeth. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the branches come indeed from the truncke,<note place="margin">A Simile.</note> and receiue ſap by it, but from the root: ſo do theſe graces come of <hi>Loue,</hi> from <hi>Faith.</hi> So that <hi>Loue</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the mother of theſe, as the Apoſtle, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. ſheweth, that the fruits of <hi>Loue</hi> are <hi>Long-ſuffering,</hi> &amp;c. For as the mother for <hi>Loue</hi> doth thinke all paines<note place="margin">A Simile.</note> to be nothing, becauſe of the affection ſhee beareth towards her childe, euen ſo, if we haue loue, it will bee laborious and ſtirring. And therefore it is not enough outwardly to bow, and make curteſie, vnleſſe loue be in the heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Loue, the bond of Perfection. id eſt,</hi> whereſoeuer loue is, there will be the performance of all duties. For if there be loue towards me, I ſhall haue this man to be<note place="margin">Note.</note> my hand, to helpe me; that man to bee my foot, to carry me; and the Miniſter mine eye to direct me, &amp;c. So that hereby it is that wee are all bound and tyed together in all good duties.</p>
               <p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctrine </seg>
                  </label> And then he ſaith, we muſt haue the <hi>Peace of God to rule vs,</hi> where he noteth, that by nature our ſpirits are contentious, and ready to fall out; and therefore it is neceſſary that wee let the Spirit of God bee the controller of our out-ragious affections, as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troller of the houſe.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>Thankefulneſſe:</hi> This is another fruit of <hi>Loue,</hi>
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:17926:103"/> and a ſingular Nurce of peace and quietneſſe; when by guifts men giue one to another, and requite one another, they teſtifie their thankfulneſſe one to another. This was the practiſe of the children of God in their Feaſts and Solemnities, as we ſee in <hi>Heſter</hi> 9. 19. according as wee vſe at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the yeare, to ſend New-yeares-gifts. And therefore it is a commendable thing, and neceſſary to maintaine loue one amongſt another, to vſe to giue mutuall gifts, and to bid one another to Feaſts.</p>

               <p>To our ſelues, hee requireth of euery man the propper vſe of the word to himſelfe, <hi>the word of Chriſt dwels, &amp;c.</hi> It is called the <hi>word of</hi> CHRIST, becauſe he is the Author and obiect of it.</p>
               <p>Heere he requireth, 1. that it muſt <hi>dwell</hi> in vs. 2. it muſt bee <hi>richly</hi> in vs: 3. with all <hi>wiſedome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the firſt it muſt bee familiar with the word of God, for as <hi>Eliphah</hi> ſheweth the meanes to be famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar with God, is to be familiarlly acquainted with his word: And therefore wee muſt be acquainted with it as with that, which dwelleth in our houſe with vs. As a man may haue other acquaintance and other buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, yet his ſpeciall acquaintance is in the houſe: So ought we to bee with the word of God. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is ſaid wee muſt haue the word of God <hi>dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> in vs, it muſt not bee <hi>looſe,</hi> as <hi>Math.</hi> 13. the ſeed by the way-ſide: but it muſt be <hi>rooted</hi> in vs, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith: And Saint <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith it muſt be <hi>ingrafted</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iam. 1. 21. Heb. 2. 1. 2. 3.</note> into vs, as the graft into the ſtock. And <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. Seeing CHRIST is aboue all Angels, it behooues vs to take heed to his word that we hold it well, and bee not as riuen veſſels, that let it runne out. This the Apoſtle ſpeaketh heere, is notably ſet forth in <hi>Pſalme</hi> 119. 2.<note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 11.</note> part: Hee <hi>couered</hi> the word in his heart, as the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:17926:105"/> that couereth the ſeed in the earth, that it may take roote and bring forth fruite: So that this is to be acquainted, &amp; to haue the word dwell with vs.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we muſt take care that it dwell <hi>richly</hi> in vs. We count not him a rich man, that can talke of wealth, but that hath his treaſures and ſtore-houſes richly filled to draw out in time of need. So muſt wee bee rich in the word. And therefore as the rich man<note place="margin">A ſimile.</note> corruptly dealing is neuer ſatisfied, but is ſtill deſiring more, and is neuer content with a little, ſo ought we for the word: Againe, as the rich man taketh all paines and neuer reſts: ſo wee are to labour with dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence for the treaſure of the word: for nothing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth by idleneſſe. And hence it is that becauſe we are<note place="margin">Note.</note> not treaſured with the Word, &amp; haue it not in ſtore, wee are driuen to ſuch diſtreſſes in time of affliction and trouble: and therefore wee are to labour to haue the word richly dwelling in vs, that ſo we may draw out of our ſtore-houſes in time of need.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, and eſpecially the word muſt dwell in vs in <hi>all wiſedome:</hi> It muſt not onely bee deliuered diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly by the Miniſter (which yet is neceſſary that it be wiſely and fruitefully deliuered to euery one) but wee muſt ſee that it bee <hi>in vs, in all wiſedome,</hi> which</p>

               </list>
               <p>Firſt it is neceſſary that we come to the Word, not<note place="margin">Note.</note> for any ſiniſter <hi>end</hi> &amp; <hi>affection,</hi> for to be counted wiſe, &amp; to talke of the Word, or for to haue the report of men, but that we come onely to it, with the loue of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in regard of the <hi>vſe</hi> of the word, we are to come to the Word, not to learne to maintaine our owne errours and hereſies, or to mainetaine our ſins. As becauſe of the drunkenneſſe of <hi>Noe,</hi> or by the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:17926:106"/> filthineſſe of <hi>Lot</hi> with his daughters to take occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to maintaine drunkenneſſe and whore domes, this is an horrible abuſe of the Word: In <hi>Amos</hi> wee ſee<note place="margin">Amos 6. 3. 5. 6.</note> them reproued that would play with <hi>Dauids</hi> inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, hauing no skill or Art, that is no heart to vſe them wel; Whereas <hi>Dauid</hi> had skill by them to ſtir vp his affections: So do they that mainetaine their filthy dances by <hi>Dauids</hi> dancing.</p>
               <p>In regard of the vſe of the word, the wiſedome required of vs is, that we ſeeke and labour eſpecially for the greateſt and chiefeſt points of Religion, as holineſſe of life and heart, righteouſnes, temperance, &amp;c. <hi>Math.</hi> 23. As our Sauiour rebuketh the <hi>Scribes</hi> &amp;<note place="margin">Math. 23. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>Phariſes;</hi> Theſe things ye ſhould not haue neglected, but eſpecially you ſhould haue regarded Iuſtice, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Such are they in our time, that follow after the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine<note place="margin">Note.</note> againſt ceremonies, which they ſhould know, but not neglect other more weighty.</p>
               <p>Another point of wiſedome is, as to marke thoſe things which belong moſt eſpecially &amp; generally to all Chriſtians: ſo to marke and learne thoſe things eſpecially, which moſt eſpecially concerne ourſelues, and our ſtate, and condition. Contrary to which are they that when they heare any thing, which is againſt the ſinnes of others, take hold of that preſently<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but let paſſe what concernes themſelues. Inferiors looke to thoſe things, that are rebuked in their ſuperiors: and ſuperiors to thoſe things, that are reproued in their inferiors, not in themſelues, which wee ought to regard moſt. As if wee feele ſluggiſhneſſe in our<note place="margin">Note.</note> ſelues, we are to marke the doctrine, which may moſt ſtir vs vp: if we feele hardneſſe of heart in our ſelues, wee ought to giue eare to the doctrine, which may ſoften vs.</p>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:17926:106"/>
               <p>Thus much of the vſe of the word in regard of our ſelues: In regard of others; wee, euen all generally, are to help &amp; teach others in the word, ſo as that we go not out of our callings, vſurping publicke authority, being but priuate men: Thus thoſe that haue know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, ſhould teach &amp; inſtruſt them that are ignorant in that which they know not: &amp; in this regard a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man may teach another, one brother another, thoſe that haue knowledge to teach the ignorant, &amp; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming them in that, which they know amiſſe.<note place="margin">Col. 3. 16. Heb. 10. 25.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Another duty we owe to others, in regard of the vſe of the word to our neighbour is, if he fall to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh him of his ſinne, and thereby to helpe him vp: And therefore the Apoſtle ſaith admoniſh one another. And by admoniſhing is alſo vnderſtood a <hi>comforting</hi> of thoſe, and <hi>exhorting</hi> of them, that do wel.</p>
               <p>Here we ſee what a ſhamefull doctrine of Poperie it is to take away the word from all but Miniſters. Whereas the Apoſtle maketh it a duty to all, euen to women, whom they can not abide to be teachers, which yet they may in their own houſes, giuing place notwithſtanding to the men, if there be any, but yet they may reproue thoſe, that offend in their houſes.</p>
               <p>Thus much of the behauiour towards men. Towards God the duty is ſet down, that when we are merry &amp;<note place="margin">Verſe 16.</note> cheerfull to ſing pſalmes and Hymnes vnto God.</p>
               <p>And therefore Saint <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith, if any be mery,<note place="margin">Iam. 5. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>let him ſing Pſalmes;</hi> ſo that it is a good thing that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of the bleſſings of God we ſhould be mery and glad: but our mirth muſt be to the end we may glorifie, and praiſe God for it.</p>
               <p>This praiſing of God. 1. with Pſalmes, which were Pſalmes vſed with the <hi>voice</hi> and <hi>inſtrument</hi> both, and<note place="margin">Pſal. 108. 2. Pſal. 50. 4.</note> therefore <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, <hi>ariſe lute and harpe,</hi> and bids
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:17926:107"/> vs ſing vpon the organes &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And that this word ſignifieth thus, it appeareth,<note place="margin">Dan. 3 7.</note> becauſe in <hi>Daniell</hi> there is an inſtrument called a <hi>Pſaltery:</hi>

               <p>Laſtly, a ſong is a more generall thing then either the <hi>Pſalme,</hi> or <hi>Hymne, viz.</hi> wherein we giue thanks not for perticuler benefits, but for generall bleſſings receiued at Gods hands, as when <hi>Dauid</hi> praiſed the Lord for the works of creation, as the heauens &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This teacheth vs that we ſhould not be a weary<note place="margin">Pſal. 104. <hi>Doctrine.</hi>

               <p>Here we ſee condemned the ſongs of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> which ſing that which they vnderſtand not, and therefore with what affection can they do it? and be it that their affection be good, yet their vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, being wanting, they ſing not aright.

And becauſe it were an infinite thing to ſet downe all duties perticular to Chriſtians, he wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comprehendeth all, both thoſe duties ſpoken of before, &amp; all other duties in this verſe, ſaying: <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer yee ſay, or do, let all be done in the name of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt.</hi> The like doth our Sauiour Chriſt, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſpoken in the 5. and 6. and part of the 7. of <hi>Mathew,</hi> of the duties to our neighbours, doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend all the duties which we owe to our brother, in all the Law and Prophets, in this: <hi>Do as ye would be</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Math. 7. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>done by.</hi> So here the Apoſtle doth. The like we haue, 1. <hi>Cor. 10. Whether ye eate or drinke, or whatſoeuer ye do,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 10. 31. <hi>Note.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>do all to the glory of God.</hi> Here we haue a very <hi>Notable rule,</hi> that we ſhould not ſpeake, nor do any thing, but that which we may commend vnto God in prayer: And therfore euery man ought to purpoſe with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in the day, to do nothing elſe but that which is good and right: and this will be a meanes to keepe him from whoring, drinking, &amp; all vnhoneſt things, when as he is to do onely that which he ſhould deſire a bleſſing in prayer of God in; and for which after we are to returne to God in thankeſ-giuing againe, which none is ſo ſenceleſſe as that hee will do for his
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:17926:109"/> ſinnes, and wickedneſſe he hath committed. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there is no good thing, whatſoeuer a man doth, as to ſpeake of Law, Phyſicke, &amp;c. which of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues are good, and therefore cannot be good vnto vs (though to others they may be) vnleſſe we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them vnto the Lord in prayer.</p>
               <p>Here alſo we are taught, in that we are to pray to God, and thanke God for all good things, we ſay and do, we haue them not of our ſelues, but from the Lord.</p>
               <p>After the Apoſtle doth ſet downe a notable Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition<note place="margin">Verſe. 18.</note> of the fifth Commandement, 1. beginning at the duties of the neereſt bonds: and firſt hee ſetteth the duty of the inferiors to the ſuperiors. And firſt he ſheweth forth the duties of thoſe which owe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> duties together one to another mutually, as huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and wife: and then the duties of them ioyntly to thoſe that are vnderneath them both.</p>
               <p>And this is the order which the Apoſtle vſeth, who hauing ſet downe generall duties of Chriſtianity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he now commeth to particular; thereby inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating, that thoſe that haue laboured to obſerue the generall, as of <hi>Holineſſe, Temperancy, Long-ſuffering, Loue, &amp;c.</hi> they ſhall more eaſily performe theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular duties. This is a notable doctrine, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſee <hi>Iethro</hi> counſelleth <hi>Moſes</hi> to chooſe ſuch<note place="margin">Exod. 18. 21.</note> rulers to helpe him, as hated couetouſneſſe. This is a generall duty to hate couetouſneſſe; noting, that if they were faithfull in that, they would be good Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours, and Magiſtrates<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Captaines. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſee <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> hauing all which his maiſter had,<note place="margin">Gen. 39. 5. 9.</note> vnder his hand ſaue his wife, is ſaid to haue ordered all things well: the reaſon is, becauſe hee <hi>feared God,</hi> that is, becauſe he had the generall duty.</p>
               <pb n="210" facs="tcp:17926:110"/>
               <p>Againe, therefore we ſee, that ſeruants by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall duty of doing their duty in the ſight of God, are perſwaded to obedience to their maiſters. So that this is to teach vs to labour principally for to haue the loue and feare of God, and to do our duties as in the ſight of God, which is a meanes to helpe vs in our particular calling.</p>
               <p>And as it is a true thing, that if I loue all men, and performe duty to all men, as much as I can, then much more will I do it to my wife, children, &amp; thoſe that depend vpon me, according to this Rule of the Apoſtle.</p>
               <p>And as that is true, ſo alſo the diligent and true performance of the duties of our particular calling, is a great meanes to helpe, and to confirme vs in the generall duties. 1. <hi>Rom.</hi> The Apoſtle taking an oath, and calling God to witneſſe, confirmeth the faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his oath, by his faithfulneſſe in his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar office of his Miniſtery. And to <hi>Timothy</hi> hee ſaith:<note place="margin">1. Tim. 3. 5.</note> that he that is not able to gouerne his wife and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly priuately, is not fit to gouerne publickely in the Church, or Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>For the particular duties firſt of <hi>Wiues.</hi> In the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to <hi>Titus,</hi> though the Apoſtle requireth <hi>Loue</hi> of<note place="margin">Tit. 2. 4.</note> the yonger wiues to their husbands, and children, yet they are not ſo ready to bee behinde hand in <hi>Loue,</hi> as in this duty of <hi>Subiection:</hi> for when ſhe is admitted to the friendly and amiable vſe of her Husband, that ſhe hath <hi>Power ouer his body,</hi> as he of hers, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin">1. Cor. 7. 4.</note> ſhe thinkes ſhe is ſhut out from ſubiection to his authority: and therefore it is that the Apoſtle ſo ſtands eſpecially vpon that duty of ſubiection: for concerning loue it is vſually more exceeding in wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men then in men.</p>
               <pb n="211" facs="tcp:17926:110"/>
               <p>And therefore <hi>Dauid</hi> in his verſes on <hi>Ionathan,</hi> ſaith:<note place="margin">2. Sam. 1. 26.</note> his <hi>loue exceeded the loue of women.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But he inſiſteth vpon her <hi>obedience:</hi> And hee brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth this reaſon, becauſe it is <hi>comely:</hi> It had beene a notable reaſon to haue perſwaded her to ſubiection, becauſe the Lord commands her will to bee ſubiect vnto her husband: And howſoeuer before the fall ſhe<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 16. 1. Cor. 14. 34.</note> was ſubiected vnto him, yet after the fall, her yoke was heauier, &amp; therfore the Lord ſaith: <hi>Thy wil ſhall be ſubiect to thy husband, &amp; he ſhall rule ouer thee.</hi> Againe, as 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 9. Hee might haue ſaid the woman was made <hi>for the man,</hi> not the man for the woman. And<note place="margin">Gen. 2. 18.</note> the woman was taken out of the man, not the man out of the woman.</p>
               <p>And a more notable reaſon is in 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 14. The woman was deceiued, not the man: for hee was led away by affection to her, and was not deceiued: And to <hi>Titus,</hi> the Apoſtle rendreth another reaſon of this<note place="margin">Tit. 2. 5.</note> ſubiection, <hi>leaſt the Goſpell be euill ſpoken of,</hi> therefore the wiues ſhould be ſubiect to their husbands.</p>
               <p>But here the Apoſtle rendreth this reaſon, that it<note place="margin">Note.</note> is <hi>comely:</hi> becauſe women delight in <hi>neateneſſe</hi> and <hi>comlineſſe.</hi> And howſoeuer they thinke it a diſgrace to be ſubiect, yet the Apoſtle ſaith, this is more come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be ſubiect. And S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſtandeth much vpon it,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 3. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6.</note> teaching that the comlineſſe of a woman, which is moſt comely in the ſight of God, is, that ſhe be quiet, humble, and obedient: And therefore if women will haue their rings, Iewels, and bracelets, as an orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and comelineſſe to them, let them bee decked with this, <hi>to bee humble in obedience</hi> to their husbands.</p>
               <p>And yet this ſubiection is reſtrained, that it <hi>be in the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verſe 18. &amp; Ephe. 5. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>Lord,</hi> if hee bee too ſeuere, and command things not fit, yet ſhe is not to reiect the yoke of obedience,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:17926:111"/> but go vnder it, but if hee giue commandement <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi> to God, ſhee is not to obey therein: following the Apoſtles rule, <hi>It is better to obey God then Man.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 4. 19.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Then hee ſetteth downe the duty of husbands:<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erſe 19.</note> And howſoeuer there are many duties inioyned the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet the principall duty the Apoſtle requireth is <hi>loue,</hi> becauſe men are vſually <hi>ſhort</hi> and <hi>cold</hi> in that affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Indeed in the affection and loue for <hi>fornication</hi> they will be oftentimes <hi>exceeding hot:</hi> but in this <hi>true loue</hi> are farre ſhort and too <hi>ſtrait-laced.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Apoſtle ſetteth forth this affection of a man in <hi>Ephe:</hi> 5. ſaying that he ſhould loue his wife, as <hi>his</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ephe. 5. 28. 1. Pet. 3. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>owne body:</hi> And the reaſon is, becauſe ſhee is <hi>weaker,</hi> and full of infirmities, and weakeneſſes, and therefore he is to <hi>couer</hi> them by loue: For if he haue maymes, or<note place="margin">Prou. 10. 12.</note> blemiſhes in his body, hee will bee ready to vſe all meanes to hide them, ſo muſt the man do to his wife, being his owne body.</p>
               <p>And the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> ſheweth a generall<note place="margin">1. Pet. 4. 8.</note> duty of loue, to couer many infirmities: <hi>Aboue all things</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>haue feruent loue, for lour ſhall couer the multitude of ſinnes.</hi> And the Apoſtle ſaith further,<note place="margin">Note.</note> hee is not to bee <hi>bitter,</hi> For loue hath no <hi>gall</hi> in it, and therefore the husband is to exerciſe his loue toward his wife by auoiding all manner of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe toward her.</p>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23"/> Your ſeruice ought alſo to bee voluntary and cheerefull, as that which is due to the Lord, who lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth a cheerefull giuer, and not as vnto man that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſcerne whether it be done frankely.</p>

               <p>The ſumme is, the ſetting forth of the duty of the laſt pare and couple in the houſhold, <hi>id eſt,</hi> of the Maiſters and ſeruants.</p>
               <p>But firſt wee are to ſpeake of that, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth of the other Text; of Children and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</p>
               <p>Firſt, childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded to giue obedience to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents:<note place="margin">Verſe 20.</note> by <hi>obedience</hi> is meant all duties which children
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:17926:112"/> owe to their parents, which are diuers. And firſt of a duty, which belongeth to all them in the houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, husband, wife, parents, children, maiſters, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, <hi>viz.</hi> to pray perticulerly one for another, and more perticulerly then for others: for parents, that they are bound to it, we ſee it in <hi>Iob,</hi> that he prayed<note place="margin">Iob. 1.</note> for his children being at feaſting, leaſt they ſhould let any ſinne ouerpaſſe them in their feaſting, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they might offend. And by the ſame reaſon chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are bound to pray for their parents. And alſo by the commandement the ſubiects are commanded<note place="margin">1. Tim. 2, 1. 2</note> to pray for their Princes. And ſo Princes to pray for their people, as <hi>Dauid</hi> doth in ſundry pſalmes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he maketh prayer for himſelfe and his people.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Kings 18. Salomon</hi> alſo doth the like in ſecond Chronicles 6. 21. But to come to <hi>more perticuler</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Particular du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</note> duties of children to their parents 1. <hi>Reuerence, viz.</hi> a ſpeciall reuerence, which they are to cary to their parents aboue others, ſecondly, <hi>loue,</hi> a perticuler loue of their parents, in regard alſo that they are ſet ouer them of God. Theſe are <hi>inward</hi> things. <hi>Outward,</hi> duties are firſt a <hi>reuerent behauiour</hi> in their counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and cariage towards them, in their wordes and in their workes, to be ready to obey and do thoſe things, they are commanded, not <hi>contrary</hi> to God.</p>
               <p>And therefore it is ſaid in <hi>all things, viz.</hi> not to<note place="margin">Note.</note> obey their parents in that which they themſelues like, but in all things, though <hi>hard</hi> and <hi>contrary</hi> to their <hi>owne</hi> liking, if it be <hi>not againſt</hi> the word of God.</p>
               <p>And one ſpeciall duty of obedience, is to <hi>beare</hi> with all, and <hi>couer</hi> the <hi>infirmities</hi> of their parents, as <hi>Sem</hi> and <hi>Iaphet</hi> did to their father <hi>Noah.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen, 9, 23,</note>
               </p>
               <p>Further, if the parents haue need, they are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue, and maintaine their parents, 1. Tim. 5. 4. for if
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:17926:113"/> the children be able to maintaine them, the Church is not to be burdened.</p>
               <p>Amongſt other, a moſt notable duty is that, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by<note place="margin">Note.</note> children are to yeeld obedience to their parents in being beſtowed by their parents in their occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and manner of life. And therefore we ſee that <hi>Adam</hi> beſtowed his ſonnes, one in tilling the land, the other in keeping cattle.</p>
               <p>But more eſpecially in <hi>marriage,</hi> they are not to ſuffer themſelues to be beſtowed without their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents conſent: Where we ſee the wretched diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of children, that will giue themſelues at their owne pleaſure, contrary to their parents conſent. And a <hi>wretched</hi> and <hi>fooliſh</hi> peeuiſhneſſe-crept into<note place="margin">Note.</note> the harts of children, that they will take it in <hi>great diſlike,</hi> if their parents be ſpoken vnto <hi>before</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, cleane contrary to the example of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and euen contrary to the practiſe of heathen and naturall men.</p>
               <p>As we ſee <hi>Iſmael</hi> would not marry, but by his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers conſent: and contrariwiſe what a hart-brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king was it to <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Rebecca,</hi> that <hi>Eſaw</hi> married<note place="margin">Gen. 18.</note> contrary to their conſent? So that this is a ſpeciall duty of children, both ſonnes and daughters, not to marry, or chooſe their husbands or wiues, without their parents conſent. So that their parents do match them ſo, as may be equall and fit for them, in regard<note place="margin">Note.</note> of age, eſtate, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Whereas if parents force their children contrarie to reaſon for gaine &amp;c. they deale wretchedly in that. And as parents are not to force their children, ſo children are not to diſobey their parents, when in age and condition they find out <hi>fit matches</hi> for them in any ſort.</p>
               <pb n="217" facs="tcp:17926:113"/>
               <p>And a reaſon, that parents are to be obeyed of<note place="margin">Note.</note> their children in thoſe things, that are good, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are obedient alſo in the ſame <hi>vnto the Lord.</hi> And we know it is an eaſy matter, if with one whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a man may paint two wals, it is more eaſy for him to paint one. But our obedience therefore muſt be in the Lord, <hi>viz.</hi> onely in thoſe things, <hi>onely</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they command according to God. And therefore<note place="margin">Ioh. 2.</note> our Sauiour CRHIST, when his mother bid him change water into wine, refuſed, he denied her, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the time was not come. But we may not ſpeake as he ſpake: for we muſt, if they command vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the word of God, with <hi>all reuerence</hi> deny to do it, and not in any controlling or ſnappiſh faſhion.</p>
               <p>In that he ſaith <hi>parents,</hi> he meaneth both father and mother, for children, becauſe the father hath more authority, and becauſe peraduenture the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance lyeth vpon his diſpoſition, will obey their father, but they care not for their mother.</p>
               <p>Howbeit obedience is commanded to both. And<note place="margin">Ex. 10 12.</note> howſoeuer it commeth oftentimes that the children are diſobedient by the too much tenderneſſe of the parents: yet the children are not to truſt to that, for if they leeſe their parents loue through their wicked, behauiour, they can not aſſure themſelues of Gods.<note place="margin">Note</note>
               </p>
               <p>A fooliſh ſonne ſaith <hi>Salomon</hi> doth ouerthrow his fathers eſtate, and driues away his mother, <hi>viz.</hi> both ouerthroweth and driueth away both, and maketh parents that they cannot abide the ſight of them.</p>
               <p>As the hatred of brethren is ſtrong, becauſe their<note place="margin">A ſimile.</note> loue, which was great, is broken. So if parents loue, which is farre greater, be broken, the hatred will be the more.</p>

Secondly to lay vp for their children, 2. Cor. 12. 14.</p>
               <p>And further, not to <hi>prouoke</hi> them by vndiſcreet<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erſe 21.</note> correction, in not correcting them, according to their ſexes and ages, as when they correct their ſonnes and daughters, and all alike: which may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke them, or giue occaſion at the leaſt (for children ought to beare it patiently though they be iniuried) yet they may diſcourage their children by <hi>indiſcret</hi> and <hi>too hard</hi> correction.</p>
               <p>And on the other ſide, parents are to take heed that they kill not their children by too much pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering them, which is oft times the cauſe of the death of their ſoule &amp; body, as <hi>Dauid</hi> did his ſonnes, who when he was loath to diſpleaſe them, <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolon</hi> ſought his kingdome, and his life, and defiled his Concubines.</p>
               <p>Then he commeth to the next couple, of ſeruants and maſters. And ſeruants are commanded to be<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erſe. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>obedient to their maſters</hi> in the <hi>fleſh.</hi> So called, firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are onely for this life, and can reach no further; <hi>mitigating</hi> the ſharpneſſe of ſeruice in thoſe times, wherein ſeruants were bond-ſlaues, ſo that all, that was the ſeruants, was the maſters.</p>
               <p>For otherwiſe, 1. Cor. 7. 22. The Apoſtle ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth that ſeruants be Gods <hi>free-men,</hi> as well as the maſters, if they be Gods children. Secondly, maſters of the fleſh, becauſe they cannot command their ſoules, but onely their body.</p>
               <p>The dutyfullneſſe of ſeruants conſiſteth in 2. things:
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:17926:114"/> firſt that it be done with <hi>faithfulneſſe,</hi> not with <hi>ey ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,</hi> but as in the preſence of God. Secondly that it be done <hi>willingly,</hi> and <hi>freely,</hi> and frankely. For the<note place="margin">1. Cor. 9. 7.</note> Lord (2. Cor. 9.) loueth a <hi>chearfull giuer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, they muſt doe it,<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erſe. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>as vnto God.</hi> Examples we haue of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeruant, whoſe faithfulneſſe we ſee, who being ſent to fetch a wife for his maſters ſonne, when he came to the<note place="margin">Gen. 24. 12.</note> place fell vpon his knees, and prayed, and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his buſineſſe to God. Which teacheth that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants<note place="margin">Note.</note> muſt not onely be faithfull, but carefull by commending their buſineſſe vnto God: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are to pray both for ſtrength, and <hi>wiſedome</hi> in their maſters buſineſſe.</p>
               <p>Againe, we ſee in him a ſinguler diligence, in that comming to the place, ſet vp the camels, and ſaw them ſerued, before he would reſt, though he was a weary, &amp; would not eate before he had his anſwer. And chapter. 31. in <hi>Iacobs</hi> faithfulneſſe to <hi>Laban</hi> his vncle.</p>
               <p>In Iacob we ſee his diligence, and paynes, both in <hi>the heat</hi> of the day, and in <hi>froſt</hi> of the night. And as the greater and waightier the buſineſſe of his maſter is, by ſo much the more he is to commend his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe vnto the Lord, and ought to be more carefull.</p>
               <p>A reaſon the Apoſtle rendreth, that whereas if the ſeruant haue an <hi>vnkind,</hi> or a <hi>poore</hi> maſter, that cannot, or will not repay, nor recompence his paines, he is thereby made careleſſe, yet the Lord telleth<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erſe. 24.</note> him, that if he be faithfull, he is the <hi>Lords ſeruant,</hi> and he will reward him with an <hi>inheritance,</hi> accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him as a <hi>child.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He that doth iniury.</hi> This is brought as a reaſon both to the maiſter and ſeruant, that if the maſter
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:17926:115"/> be iniurious vnto the ſeruant, the Lord will<note place="margin">God is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpector of perſons.</note> not ſpare him, becauſe of his wealth and high eſtate, becauſe he is aboue his ſeruant: as earthly iudges will oftentimes be partiall.

                  <p>And therefore it is requiſit that the maſter ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the ſeruant in ſome ſort as a child, and in that regard to carry an <hi>equall</hi> hand to him, as to his child,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:17926:116"/> and to loue him. And therefore we ſee that <hi>Naamans</hi>

                  <p>Furthermore according to their ſeruants faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, and as they haue profited their maſter by their ſeruice, ſo ought they to reward them.

                  <p>The ſumme is an exhortation vnto certaine Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian duties, eſpecially concerning the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> though belonging alſo to all Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>Firſt a duty towards God, <hi>viz:</hi> prayer.</p>
                  <p>Secondly towards men, how to carry themſelues, whether within or without the Church.</p>
                  <p>For prayer in generall, wee are to conſider, that it conſiſts on two parts, <hi>petition</hi> and <hi>thankeſ-giuing,</hi> and therefore by prayer hee onely meaneth heere <hi>petition,</hi> and <hi>ſuit</hi> vnto God, becauſe of the other part, <hi>viz</hi> thankeſ-giuing, he after exhorts them them too.</p>
                  <p>Concerning prayer, the excellency of it is not here to bee ſpoken of: as that it is a <hi>key</hi> to open all Gods treaſures, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>But wee are to conſider that which the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of heere, <hi>viz:</hi> exhorting them to continue, and to bee watchfull vnto prayer: by which, both <hi>continuance</hi> and <hi>feruency</hi> in prayer are vnderſtood: For continuance in prayer, it is the ſame as to pray alwaies, as the Apoſtle requireth in another place, when hee ſaith: <hi>pray continually:</hi> It is not meant<note place="margin">1. Theſſ. 5. 17.</note> that one ſhould doe nothing but pray: for then wee ſhould not eate nor ſleepe. But hee meaneth that wee ought to keepe a ſteddy and continued courſe of prayer, not onely publickely, but priuately, and particularly in our cloſets. For wee haue not onely generall, but particular matters to pray for, which concerne our ſelues particularly.</p>
                  <p>And the Apoſtle ſaith that men are to continue this ordinary courſe of priuate prayer: For many will beginne, but will ſoone bee a weary of it: And therefore hee meaneth that the ordinary courſe, which wee ſee vſed to bee three times a day ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:17926:118"/> is not to bee left off. And therefore it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the ordinary ſacrifice, which was onely in the morning and euening offered, yet called the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all<note place="margin">Exod. 29. 38. 40. 41.</note> ſacrifice, becauſe it was continually offered euery day.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in that hee ſaith, <hi>watch</hi> vnto prayers, hee<note place="margin">Note.</note> noteth that it muſt bee a <hi>feruent,</hi> not a <hi>drowſy</hi> prayer, and wee muſt keepe our mindes cloſe vnto God, that they doe not wander abroad: And that it bee done with <hi>earneſtneſſe,</hi> not <hi>drowſineſſe,</hi> which is oft turned into ſinne: which commeth either from the <hi>cares</hi> of this life, or from <hi>ſorrow:</hi> As the Diſciples, when our Sauiour exhorted them to pray, they by <hi>ſorrow</hi> for his departure were ouer-come with<note place="margin">Luke 22. 45.</note> ſleepe.</p>
                  <p>But furthermore, as wee are to aske in prayer, ſo wee are to returne vnto the Lord in thankeſ-gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, contrary to the cuſtome of men, that are watchfull enough to aske, but returne not with thankes: and a generall fault it is that wee are <hi>long</hi> in our <hi>Petitions,</hi> and <hi>ſhort</hi> in our <hi>Thankeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This corruption wee ſee in the nine Leapers,<note place="margin">Luk. 17. 17. 18</note> that were earneſt in their petitions vnto CHRIST, but forgot to giue thankes, when they had receiued their deſires.</p>
                  <p>But the Apoſtle exhorts vs to bee as watchfull to thankſ-giuing, as to petition, contrary to our corrupt nature.</p>
                  <p>And ſeeing by reaſon of the benefits of God wee want, and our great wants, wee haue neede to aske ſupply of God.</p>
                  <p>So is there none of vs, but wee haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued many and ample bleſſings of God; and
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:17926:118"/> therefore haue as iuſt cauſe to returne him thankes.</p>
                  <p>But many men haue their eye all vpon their wants, that they wil neuer look vpon the graces &amp; bleſſings of God, beſtowed on them, whereof they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfull.</p>
                  <p>And as many are faulty in this, ſo there are more which are guilty of this fault, as to thinke all is well with them; and therefore cry <hi>Peace, peace</hi> to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, thinking they haue need of no more grace of God: and therefore neglect to cry and ſue vnto God earneſtly for further graces and mercies. And as it is a generall ſinne, in regard of mens particular eſtate, ſo alſo in regard of the generall eſtate of the Church. This is a generall ſinne, that men forget to pray for things ſhe needs, and to giue thankes for fauours ſhewed her.</p>
                  <p>And many there are, who haue their eyes ſtill vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<note place="margin">Note.</note> the wants and blemiſhes of the Church, and are ſtill crying out vpon them; And becauſe of that, are neuer thankfull vnto God for thoſe mercies that God hath beſtowed vpon the Church, as the Word, and Sacraments, which they may freely come vnto in peace: yet they ſay, that all is but as Popery, ſo vnthankfull vnto God are they for theſe mercies, contemning them, as nothing, becauſe they want thoſe which are are alſo conuenient.</p>
                  <p>Another ſort of people in the Church there are that ſeeing themſelues better then other Churches, in other places, content themſelues with their eſtate, which they haue, as though there could bee no a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment, nor remouall of thoſe corruptions which are yet remaining: whereas yet there ought to bee this care in euery one of vs, that as we ought to be
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:17926:119"/> thankefull for the mercies. God giueth vnto the Church, which are to be thanked for; ſo further we being not our ſelues by our place able to reforme the wants, yet ought wee to goe to the Lord for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe.</p>
                  <p>And the Magiſtrates eſpecially are to labour for the reformation, according to the word of God, of thoſe things that are amiſſe. And thus much of prayer in generall.</p>
                  <p>Then he commeth to exhort them to pray parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly,<note place="margin">Verſe. 3.</note> for them which were Miniſters. Indeed praier is a principall duty, which a man can performe vnto others; which duty we owe to all men, but eſpecially to thoſe which are <hi>ouer vs;</hi> as the Magiſtrates, though<note place="margin">1. Tim. 2. 1. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>euill,</hi> much more if they be religious. And as for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſo for the Miniſters wee are to bee carefull to<note place="margin">1 Reaſon why Miniſters ſhould bee prayed for. 2 Reaſon.</note> pray for them; becauſe the Lord hath ſet them to be the ſpeciall meanes of his glory in the miniſtery of his Word, wherein they aduance the kingdome of Chriſt. Againe, they are the meanes of our calling, by deliuering the word of God for vs; and therefore they are the ordinary meanes of our ſaluation.</p>
                  <p>Againe, they are to be prayed for; becauſe in their<note place="margin">3 Reaſon.</note> fall the Diuels kingdome is exalted: And contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, by their ſtanding the Diuels fall is procured, and the kingdome of God aduanced. And we are to pray for them, that they may both <hi>teach, admoniſh,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Note.</note>

                  <p>And the Apoſtle teacheth them the cauſe why they ſhould <hi>pray for him, viz.</hi> that he may be loſed: <hi>viz.</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now he was in priſon, and could not preach, as before time, indeed being bound, yet <hi>the word was not bound:</hi> for he laboured by Letters and Epiſtles, which hee ſent abroad to this Citty, and that Citty: And
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:17926:119"/> therefore he wils them to pray that he may haue free liberty to ſpeake: and therefore compares the <hi>ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> of his mouth to a <hi>doore,</hi> that it may be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly opened, to preach the whole will of God to all men freely, without any flattery, <hi>or reſtraint.</hi> And he giueth a reaſon that they ſhould pray for the opening of their mouthes, becauſe it is a <hi>Myſtery;</hi> ſignifying that the Goſpell is a hid thing, a thing hid from the <hi>wit</hi> and <hi>reaſon</hi> of men: for howſoeuer the knowledge<note place="margin">Note.</note> that there is a God, and the creation be no myſteries, becauſe euery one hath that knowledge naturally in him, though the Atheiſts would gladly put out that light: yet the redemption by our Sauiour Chriſt is a myſtery hid from the reaſon of Men and Angels, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was reueled. Againe, it is a myſtery, becauſe in a ſort it was hid from the <hi>Iewes,</hi> before the comming of Chriſt, being not ſo plainly knowne as afterward. And ſeeing it is a ſecret of God, we ought to deſire to<note place="margin">Veſe.</note> haue it <hi>opened,</hi> as men will be deſirous to know the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret councels of a Prince when they are publiſhed.</p>
                  <p>And he ſaith further, that they pray that hee may<note place="margin">

               <p>The ſumme of all which, as well of this, as of that that followeth to the end of the Epiſtle, is to giue to vnderſtand their mutual eſtate, as well his to them, as theirs to him, together with certaine ſalutations from ſome, and to ſome.</p>
               <p>But firſt we are to ſpeak of that in the former Text,<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erſe 5.</note> which remaineth to be handled, wherein the Apoſtle had exhorted them to walk <hi>wiſely,</hi> &amp; warily.

               <p>Secondly, that they ſo walk towards the ſtrangers, that they giue no occaſion to them to ſpeake euill of the Goſpell, and that by their godly conuerſation thoſe without may be called to the truth.</p>
               <p>And it is neceſſary that dwelling among wicked me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <note place="margin">Note.</note> we ſhould walke warily and wiſely, that wee bee not corrupted by them, becauſe by reaſon of the infection remaining in vs, wee are as ready to take infection from others, as the <hi>tinder</hi> to take fire.</p>
               <p>Which how dangerous it is, we reade in the example of diuers of the notable ſeruants of God: As of <hi>Lot,</hi> who by couetouſneſſe chooſing to liue in the fatteſt country of <hi>Sodom,</hi> learned their to be drunken, with<note place="margin">Gen. 19.</note> which he was ouertaken by his daughters.</p>

               <pb n="234" facs="tcp:17926:122"/>
               <p>Another cauſe why we ſhould take heed of walking<note place="margin">Foure reaſon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>3</label> which will be a cauſe to make them blame our religion.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, another cauſe why we ſhould walke wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſely is to the end that we might call the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 12. &amp;. 3. 1. 2.</note> by our godly conuerſation, hauing care eſpecially to be wary in thoſe things, which the aduerſaries of the Goſpell haue by the light of nature a ſpeciall in-ſight <label type="milestone">

               </p>
               <p>After the Apoſtle exhorteth to another matter,<note place="margin">Verſe. 5.</note> that we <hi>redeeme</hi> the time: the word ſignifieth an <hi>opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity</hi> of time, and <hi>fitneſſe.</hi> Which waryneſſe the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle draweth from the practiſe of marchants, that hauing had any great loſſe, they will watch all mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, and oportunities to recouer that loſſe, which<note place="margin">A ſimile.</note> they haue had, and to make vp the breach, they haue made in their ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, ſo are we to watch to recouer, that we haue loſt. by taking all good oportunity.</p>
               <p>And we are to do as the wayfaring man, that hauing<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Note.</hi> A ſimile.</note> ſlep't to long, or been to long at dinner, will make the more haſt after. So ought we to conſider how in
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:17926:122"/> our life time we haue ſpent the time lent vs by God, and wherein we haue been behind hand in the ſeruice of God. That whereas if our life were a 1000. yeares, (as none neuer came vnto, which yet is but a mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the life to come) it were too little to ſpend in the ſeruice of God. And therefore if any of it hath not been ſo ſpent, we are to be carefull to indeuour our ſelues according as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> exhorts vs, that, if we haue ſpent the time in drunkeneſſe gluttony, luſts, wantonneſſe, we ſhould now leaue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Redeeming the time:</hi> ſignifying that if poſſible we can, we are to buy it out, and to buy it out euen with <hi>much money,</hi> nay with our <hi>life</hi> it ſelfe, if need be.</p>
               <p>And therefore it ſheweth the notable corruption of vs, that the time, which we ought to redeeme and buy out by much coſt, we are ſo careleſſe of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that we ſpend it in our worldly gaynes and pleaſures. And therefore we ſee how men fpend and paſſe the time in cards and dice, and other vanities. We ſee our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour<note place="margin">Luk. 14. 7. 10. 13.</note> Chriſt <hi>Luke</hi> 14. being on the Saboth called to a feaſt, ſee how he redeemeth the time.

                  <hi>of God,</hi> he propounded a parable to inſtruct them therein.</p>
               <p>Another notable example of our Sauiour Chriſt, that redeemed the time, he we ſee in his taking occaſion with the poore woman, which was an harlot, to call her, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. And after, with the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, one ſeeing the harueſt taketh occaſion to giue
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:17926:123"/> a notable ſpeech to his Diſciples, to pray vnto the Lord to ſend forth reapers into his ſpirituall harueſt:<note place="margin">Math. 9. 37.

               <p>After hee commeth to a notable doctrine about<note place="margin">Verſe 6.</note> the tongue, that in regard of their godly conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Infidels they ſhould haue eſpeciall regard to vſe their tongues wel. For it is as a <hi>rudder</hi> of a ſhip, or <hi>fire,</hi> that being well vſed is profitable, if otherwiſe dangerous: And hee will haue them to order their tongues wiſely, that their ſpeech be <hi>ſeaſoned, viz:</hi> that they know when to <hi>ſpeake,</hi> when to bee <hi>ſilent:</hi> And in ſpeaking that they know how to ſpeake according to the perſons preſent, ſo to direct the ſpeach accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as is moſt fit for euery ones condition &amp; eſtate. Which as it is requiſite in the Miniſter, ſo in all men: Therefore the Apoſtle wils <hi>Tymothie</hi> to admoniſh an<note place="margin">1.
